# Hi.

This is my personal blog. I'll be migrating my posts from other platforms to this site.

I'm a software developer, a family man, a B.A. in English, and a Mormon. My writing is motivated by all of these things.

## Comment Policy

> Be pleasant. Keep it PG. Don't advertise. Don't hate.

I welcome most forms of discussion and questions. That said: distasteful opinions, rudeness, and anything NSFW will be deleted on sight. Advertisers will be blocked. This is my personal site and you do not have any free speech rights here.

## What's wrong with Medium?

A great deal of my writing has been published on Medium, and it's been a stellar platform for gaining exposure and engaging with the community. Unfortunately, it seems like Medium doesn't have a sensible path to profitability. I basically expect the site to be shuttered at any moment. I much prefer to have a little more ownership of my content and be able to decide when/if it becomes inaccessible.

## Why are there no share buttons?

I expect my primary audience to know how to copy and paste a URL to Twitter/Facebook/Mastodon/Reddit/wherever you hang out.
