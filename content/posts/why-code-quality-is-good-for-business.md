Software startups are faced with a difficult problem early in their evolution:

- We need to sell a product. Therefore, we need a product to sell.
- We need to build the product before we run out of money.

Sometimes the solution presents itself in the form of a sales call from an international contracting company, and the startup finds itself asking: Should we hire offshore contractors for $12 per hour per dev, or in-house developers for $50 per hour per dev?

This is an important question, and making the wrong call is an expensive mistake.

_The pros of offshore developers:_

- Fast.
- Cheap.
- Unquestioning.
- Easy to find.
- That's it.

Wait a minute. That sounds like everything you want. You need something you can sell to your customers and you need it pronto. It doesn't even have to be amazing, it just needs to solve the problem, and you can always refine it later, right?

Unfortunately, this ignores a few fundamental laws of software. Inexperienced and unsupervised developers write bad code (especially if they're in a hurry), and fixing bad code is about as easy as fixing burnt cake. And it will need to be fixed if your company wants to survive in the long term. In a poorly-written or rushed codebase, fixing bugs or building new features literally takes 1-2 _orders of magnitude_ longer than it would in a well-constructed codebase.

Am I implying that all offshore developers are inexperienced or unskilled? Of course not. But if they're fast _and_ cheap, I have no choice but to assume they aren't good. It makes no sense at all for a good developer, regardless of country of residence, to sell their labor at a discount, given that in today's market, a well-made app is worth its weight in gold.
