      <description>Quick poll. How many devices do you own that:&#xA;Force you to sit down and hold still in order to use them? Regularly trap you in random locations for half an hour or more? Cost you several dollars an hour, every hour they&amp;rsquo;re turned on? Take up 100 square feet, whether you&amp;rsquo;re using them or not? Sit unused most of the day while claiming 16% of your household income? Just your car?</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t received any money or free products for my opinions nor do I have any affiliate links on my blog. I&amp;rsquo;m doing this for free because I don&amp;rsquo;t have the good sense to stop.&#xA;Forget about saving the Earth for a moment. Forget about reducing smog, exercising, or keeping up with the latest trends. Forget about traffic, even.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s still worth considering an ebike as your next vehicle. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you&amp;rsquo;re a fitness-obsessed environmentalist or not; the bottom line is these things are fun and can save you a lot of money.</description>
