      <description>At time of writing, Netflix&amp;rsquo;s Standard plan costs 15.49 USD, while its Standard with ads plan costs 6.99 USD. The difference between those prices is 8.50 USD; it costs more than twice as much to watch without ads.
What&amp;rsquo;s the math on that one? Advertisers are estimated to pay up to 50 USD per thousand ad views. That&amp;rsquo;s five cents per view. In 2019, the average Netflix viewer watched about 2 hours per day—this number went up in 2020 during quarantine, but has likely come back down since.</description>
