      <description>A software developer has, in theory, the ability to walk into an outhouse with an old laptop and emerge a few days later with something worth millions of dollars. If you can build software, you can create value out of thin air. Software has no material components.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s been rightly pointed out that software does have material components, namely a working computer, which over half the world doesn&amp;rsquo;t have at home.</description>

      <description>At time of writing, Netflix&amp;rsquo;s Standard plan costs 15.49 USD, while its Standard with ads plan costs 6.99 USD. The difference between those prices is 8.50 USD; it costs more than twice as much to watch without ads.&#xA;What&amp;rsquo;s the math on that one? Advertisers are estimated to pay up to 50 USD per thousand ad views. That&amp;rsquo;s five cents per view. In 2019, the average Netflix viewer watched about 2 hours per day—this number went up in 2020 during quarantine, but has likely come back down since.</description>
