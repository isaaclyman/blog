      <description>Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice. Before starting a business, you should consult your own lawyer.
We developers are uniquely positioned to start our own companies. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to downplay the importance of managers, accountants, salespeople, and everyone else who makes a business come together, but devs bring something very rare to the table: the ability to call forth an entire high-value product from the abyss, using no raw materials whatsoever.</description>

I feel very privileged to lead the life I lead. I live in a good neighborhood. I can change jobs if I don&amp;rsquo;t like the one I have. I haven&amp;rsquo;t worried about how to pay for groceries since 2013. If I were to list all my blessings, I could go on forever&amp;mdash;but in short, I lead a far better life than I deserve and I&amp;rsquo;m anything but self-made.</description>

      <description>I’ve created this system for rating technology companies based on the way they conduct business, their place in the community and how they treat their developers. It’s a work in progress and I welcome your commentary.
There are 24 criteria under six categories. I would consider any company that scores positively on 12 or more of these criteria to be “a good place to work.” I have my doubts about whether any existing company could achieve a perfect score, so please don’t take it personally if your company comes up short in multiple areas.</description>

      <description>Are you a coder, programmer, developer, engineer, architect or something else? My first job was an underage, under-the-table weekend gig at a pizza parlor. I’d show up at the local strip mall early Saturday morning, stash my bike, and clock in. For me, the work was grueling. I would haul 50-pound bags of flour and 10-gallon buckets of water to a giant stand mixer, and once it finished spinning I’d lift armfuls of incredibly heavy dough to a metal table where I’d cut and oil portions weighed for each size of pizza that the shop sold.</description>
