      <description>Application streaming is one of the emerging technologies I&amp;rsquo;m most bullish on. So far its full potential has flown under the radar, but there are companies doing impressive things with it:
 Xbox Cloud Gaming, currently in beta, streams Xbox games from cloud servers with low latency even on an LTE connection. It&amp;rsquo;s powered by Rainway, whose streaming offering has pivoted from video games to fully-interactive streamed apps of every kind.</description>

      <title>What five tech recruiters get wrong (and right) about cold email</title>
      <link>http://isaaclyman.com/blog/posts/five-recruiters/</link>

      <description>Technical recruiters have an extraordinarily difficult job. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that in 2020 there were about two million people working in programming jobs across a few different categories. They also project that software developer employment will grow 22% by 2030, nearly three times the average rate for all occupations. And in 2019, IT trade group CompTIA reported a staggering 918,000 unfilled IT jobs over a period of three months.</description>

      <title>I&#39;m writing a book for junior developers!</title>
      <link>http://isaaclyman.com/blog/posts/im-writing-a-book/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing a book: a complete guide to your first year as a developer. And I&amp;rsquo;m looking for co-authors.
It&amp;rsquo;s not a technical manual about Python or Kubernetes or Angular. And it&amp;rsquo;s not a deep-dive about refactoring or craftsmanship. It&amp;rsquo;s a guide to the other stuff: resume writing, getting that first job, ethics, career progression, what to do when you&amp;rsquo;re stuck.
The book will be pay-what-you-want (minimum price of free).</description>

      <title>If you don&#39;t hire juniors, you don&#39;t deserve seniors</title>

      <description>Let me tell you the story of a very successful company that made a very big, dumb decision.
 We don&amp;rsquo;t hire junior developers or interns&amp;hellip;if you don&amp;rsquo;t get a puppy, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to clean up its messes.
~ Netflix
 I&amp;rsquo;m flabbergasted that some corporate schmuck figured out a way to cast puppies in a negative light and people kept listening. I mean, puppies are the purest beings on planet Earth.</description>

      <title>Hiring in tech? Don&#39;t compete on price</title>
      <link>http://isaaclyman.com/blog/posts/dont-compete-on-price/</link>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a strong business case&amp;mdash;a financially sound, common-sense case&amp;mdash;for acquiring tech talent such as developers, designers, product managers, and QA engineers using quality-of-life values instead of competing on compensation. Conversations about this topic have been taking place in online developer communities for years, but it seems these ideas haven&amp;rsquo;t penetrated the larger tech and business world. If you read on, you&amp;rsquo;ll find there&amp;rsquo;s a wealth of compelling evidence in favor of offering shorter workdays and remote options to your employees as a hiring and loyalty incentive, rather than trying to out-pay the market.</description>

      <title>Starting a business for your app</title>
      <link>http://isaaclyman.com/blog/posts/starting-a-business/</link>

      <description>Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice. Before starting a business, you should consult your own lawyer.
We developers are uniquely positioned to start our own companies. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to downplay the importance of managers, accountants, salespeople, and everyone else who makes a business come together, but devs bring something very rare to the table: the ability to call forth an entire high-value product from the abyss, using no raw materials whatsoever.</description>

I feel very privileged to lead the life I lead. I live in a good neighborhood. I can change jobs if I don&amp;rsquo;t like the one I have. I haven&amp;rsquo;t worried about how to pay for groceries since 2013. If I were to list all my blessings, I could go on forever&amp;mdash;but in short, I lead a far better life than I deserve and I&amp;rsquo;m anything but self-made.</description>

      <title>The tech company scorecard</title>

      <description>I’ve created this system for rating technology companies based on the way they conduct business, their place in the community and how they treat their developers. It’s a work in progress and I welcome your commentary.
There are 24 criteria under six categories. I would consider any company that scores positively on 12 or more of these criteria to be “a good place to work.” I have my doubts about whether any existing company could achieve a perfect score, so please don’t take it personally if your company comes up short in multiple areas.</description>

      <title>Choosing a job title</title>

      <description>This is a chapter from Your First Year in Code, a book of practical how-to and advice for new developers. If you&amp;rsquo;re considering a career in software, check it out. It&amp;rsquo;s a free download at https://leanpub.com/firstyearincode.
 Are you a coder, programmer, developer, engineer, architect or something else? My first job was an underage, under-the-table weekend gig at a pizza parlor. I’d show up at the local strip mall early Saturday morning, stash my bike, and clock in.</description>
