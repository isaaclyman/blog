      <title>Should more developers be starting software companies?</title>
      <link>http://isaaclyman.com/blog/posts/dev-companies/</link>

      <description>A software developer has, in theory, the ability to walk into an outhouse with an old laptop and emerge a few days later with something worth millions of dollars. If you can build software, you can create value out of thin air. Software has no material components.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s been rightly pointed out that software does have material components, namely a working computer, which over half the world doesn&amp;rsquo;t have at home.</description>

      <title>So software engineering isn&#39;t working out for you</title>

      <description>I used to be solidly on team &amp;ldquo;anyone can code.&amp;rdquo; That changed when I talked to my therapist about it.&#xA;ME: I&amp;rsquo;m a big believer in neuroplasticity. I think anyone can learn to do anything, it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of how long it takes.&#xA;THERAPIST (visibly uncomfortable): I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s fair.&#xA;ME: Why not?&#xA;THERAPIST: Well, for example, my partner and I have very different skills. I&amp;rsquo;m no good at some things she&amp;rsquo;s really good at, like math, and it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t matter how long I try to be good at them, I&amp;rsquo;d be wasting my time.</description>

      <title>If you don&#39;t hire juniors, you don&#39;t deserve seniors (2023)</title>

      <description>This was originally written in 2018. It remains one of my more popular blog posts, so I&amp;rsquo;ve taken some time to revise it to match the current market environment and my evolving opinions on the topic.&#xA;Let me tell you the story of a very successful company that made a very big, dumb decision.&#xA;We don&amp;rsquo;t hire junior developers or interns&amp;hellip;if you don&amp;rsquo;t get a puppy, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to clean up its messes.</description>

      <title>Cloud workstations: the future of remote work</title>

      <description>Application streaming is one of the emerging technologies I&amp;rsquo;m most bullish on. So far its full potential has flown under the radar, but there are companies doing impressive things with it:&#xA;Xbox Cloud Gaming, currently in beta, streams Xbox games from cloud servers with low latency even on an LTE connection. It&amp;rsquo;s powered by Rainway, whose streaming offering has pivoted from video games to fully-interactive streamed apps of every kind. Google Stadia is a similar service with a library of games you can buy and then play exclusively through the cloud.</description>

      <title>What five tech recruiters get wrong (and right) about cold email</title>
      <link>http://isaaclyman.com/blog/posts/five-recruiters/</link>

      <guid>http://isaaclyman.com/blog/posts/five-recruiters/</guid>
      <description>Technical recruiters have an extraordinarily difficult job. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that in 2020 there were about two million people working in programming jobs across a few different categories. They also project that software developer employment will grow 22% by 2030, nearly three times the average rate for all occupations. And in 2019, IT trade group CompTIA reported a staggering 918,000 unfilled IT jobs over a period of three months.</description>

      <title>I&#39;m writing a book for junior developers!</title>

      <guid>http://isaaclyman.com/blog/posts/im-writing-a-book/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing a book: a complete guide to your first year as a developer. And I&amp;rsquo;m looking for co-authors.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s not a technical manual about Python or Kubernetes or Angular. And it&amp;rsquo;s not a deep-dive about refactoring or craftsmanship. It&amp;rsquo;s a guide to the other stuff: resume writing, getting that first job, ethics, career progression, what to do when you&amp;rsquo;re stuck.&#xA;The book will be pay-what-you-want (minimum price of free).</description>

      <title>Hiring in tech? Don&#39;t compete on price</title>
      <link>http://isaaclyman.com/blog/posts/dont-compete-on-price/</link>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a strong business case&amp;mdash;a financially sound, common-sense case&amp;mdash;for acquiring tech talent such as developers, designers, product managers, and QA engineers using quality-of-life values instead of competing on compensation. Conversations about this topic have been taking place in online developer communities for years, but it seems these ideas haven&amp;rsquo;t penetrated the larger tech and business world. If you read on, you&amp;rsquo;ll find there&amp;rsquo;s a wealth of compelling evidence in favor of offering shorter workdays and remote options to your employees as a hiring and loyalty incentive, rather than trying to out-pay the market.</description>

      <title>Starting a business for your app</title>
      <link>http://isaaclyman.com/blog/posts/starting-a-business/</link>

      <description>Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice. Before starting a business, you should consult your own lawyer.&#xA;We developers are uniquely positioned to start our own companies. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to downplay the importance of managers, accountants, salespeople, and everyone else who makes a business come together, but devs bring something very rare to the table: the ability to call forth an entire high-value product from the abyss, using no raw materials whatsoever.</description>

      <description>Leer en español&#xA;I feel very privileged to lead the life I lead. I live in a good neighborhood. I can change jobs if I don&amp;rsquo;t like the one I have. I haven&amp;rsquo;t worried about how to pay for groceries since 2013. If I were to list all my blessings, I could go on forever&amp;mdash;but in short, I lead a far better life than I deserve and I&amp;rsquo;m anything but self-made.</description>

      <title>The tech company scorecard</title>

      <description>I’ve created this system for rating technology companies based on the way they conduct business, their place in the community and how they treat their developers. It’s a work in progress and I welcome your commentary.&#xA;There are 24 criteria under six categories. I would consider any company that scores positively on 12 or more of these criteria to be “a good place to work.” I have my doubts about whether any existing company could achieve a perfect score, so please don’t take it personally if your company comes up short in multiple areas.</description>

      <description>This is a chapter from Your First Year in Code, a book of practical how-to and advice for new developers. If you&amp;rsquo;re considering a career in software, check it out. It&amp;rsquo;s a free download at https://leanpub.com/firstyearincode.&#xA;Are you a coder, programmer, developer, engineer, architect or something else? My first job was an underage, under-the-table weekend gig at a pizza parlor. I’d show up at the local strip mall early Saturday morning, stash my bike, and clock in.</description>
