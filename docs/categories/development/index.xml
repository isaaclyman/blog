      <description>Uniform distribution If you roll a 20-sided die (commonly called a d20), there&amp;rsquo;s an equal chance of rolling any number between 1 and 20. Over the course of infinite rolls, you&amp;rsquo;ll roll about the same number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and so on. That&amp;rsquo;s called a &amp;ldquo;uniform distribution.&amp;rdquo; The d20, popularized by Dungeons and Dragons, is the best and worst thing to happen to tabletop gaming: the best because it creates moments of triumph and despair in otherwise ho-hum games, and the worst because it creates periods of boredom in otherwise exciting games.</description>

      <description>Today I had an interesting problem to solve. For a given two-dimensional array (or matrix), I needed to construct some efficient views into the data from multiple angles.&#xA;Rows! final List&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;&amp;gt; rows = [ [1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], ]; This is an example of the data I was starting with. You might call it an &amp;ldquo;array of rows.&amp;rdquo; In terms of tabular data, the indices of the outer array are the rows, and the indices of each inner array are the columns.</description>

What are you thinking about?&#xA;If you&amp;rsquo;re using a mainstream, high-level, memory-managed language like C#, Python, Java, or JavaScript, you&amp;rsquo;re thinking about:&#xA;The parameters Their types What the function will do with the information they contain The return value Its type Which are good and reasonable things to think about, and most of the time, for most things, they&amp;rsquo;re all you should think about.</description>

      <description>You can find all the code for this series on GitHub.&#xA;Kryptos 4 is, I repeat, unsolved. We&amp;rsquo;re very unlikely to solve it today. Enthusiastic codebreakers have been putting together clues and proposing theories for decades. At least half of them are like this:&#xA;But hey, since we&amp;rsquo;ve got some code ready to go, we might as well try.&#xA;Setup All the code we&amp;rsquo;ve written so far is available on GitHub.</description>

      <description>You can find all the code for this series on GitHub.&#xA;Kryptos 3 is going to require more code than anything else so far. It&amp;rsquo;s encoded using both the types of transposition we covered in Part 2, plus a twist.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s written out with a rectangle size of 86 and a block size of 7. The columns are stacked. A keyed columnar cipher is applied with the key &amp;lsquo;KRYPTOS&amp;rsquo;. (KRYPTOS is seven characters long, which is why our block size is 7.</description>

      <description>You can find all the code for this series on GitHub.&#xA;In the previous post we solved Kryptos 1 and 2. Kryptos 3 is going to be a bit tougher. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t use our trusty Vigenere cipher. And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t use just one cipher, either; it uses two. We&amp;rsquo;ll learn them separately in this post, then use them together in the next one.&#xA;Keyed columnar transposition We need to learn a transposition cipher, which is where the letters in a message are rearranged but not changed.</description>

      <description>You can find all the code for this series on GitHub.&#xA;On the campus of CIA headquarters in Virginia, United States, there&amp;rsquo;s a 34-year-old sculpture called Kryptos. It somewhat resembles a heavy copper flag waving in the wind. Cut out of its surface are 1,736 uppercase ASCII characters split into four encrypted messages and a Vigenere cipher table.&#xA;The first three messages were decrypted in the 1990s, first by the NSA and CIA, who didn&amp;rsquo;t publicize their success, and then by a private-sector computer scientist, who did.</description>

      <description>Software projects are most efficient when, at any given time, each contributor is focused on a different concern. Like objects in 3D space, projects can be said to have surface area and volume:&#xA;Surface area represents the number of opportunities to contribute—that is, how many people could efficiently work on the project at the same time. Volume represents the knowledge space of the project (measured, perhaps, in the total number of productive person-hours spent on it).</description>

      <description>I’m relatively young on the programming scene (I wasn&amp;rsquo;t around when FORTRAN came out or anything) so this is a hubristic thing to say, but it feels like we’ve reached Peak Programming Languages. For anything you want to build and any way you want to build it, there&amp;rsquo;s a mature and popular language already available. Typically the community around it is robust and the syntax is delightful. I mean, just try writing a few lines of C# or Dart and tell me it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel nice.</description>

Sliding the card&amp;rsquo;s magnetic strip (the black stripe) through a card reader. This method was invented by IBM in the 1960s and has been in use ever since, but it&amp;rsquo;s on its way out. In a few short years many credit cards will no longer have a magnetic strip.</description>

      <description>Computer processing is the act by which the world of the computer is constructed. We can call it a world because it appears to exist unto itself, persisting its environment and taking scripted actions well outside of our awareness. Modern computers rarely shut off completely, so the illusion of persistence (&amp;ldquo;my user desktop is still there even when my computer is asleep; I just drop in on it now and then&amp;rdquo;) is not entirely an illusion.</description>

      <description>Classic pipelines are out, YAML pipelines are in. Azure DevOps (ADO) has adopted a pipelines-as-code philosophy that will be their build and release strategy for the foreseeable future. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to appreciate about the new pipelines, though they are a bit of a mental adjustment and the transition is anything but automatic&amp;mdash;I took a few weeks converting all of ours, though there were some special obstacles in our case that hopefully you won&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with.</description>

      <description>The search for the lost AirPod My wife Dylan is a math and physics teacher. Yesterday while she was on a Zoom call with a student I got a text message from her: &amp;ldquo;the kids have my AirPods.&amp;rdquo; She knew because her student was cracking up laughing at the babblings of our toddlers, captured by the built-in microphone on the AirPods.&#xA;I tracked down the kids. They were carrying around an AirPod case with one AirPod in it.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about one of my favorite .NET features.&#xA;IEnumerable is an interface for iterating over a collection. In other words, if something is an IEnumerable, you can mostly think of it like an Array or a List. You can use a foreach statement to loop through it, you can use LINQ to map or reduce it in a hundred different ways, or you can explicitly cast it to an array with .</description>

      <description>Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to go from 0 to a configurable load testing script using JMeter, a free and popular load testing tool. We&amp;rsquo;ll be moving quickly, so hold on tight.&#xA;What is load testing? If your app or service is very successful, hundreds of people might be using it at once. Lots of things can go wrong when a server is under heavy usage like that. It&amp;rsquo;s not economical to recruit hundreds of actual people to test your app manually, so your best choice is to use software to simulate it.</description>

The &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; stands for &amp;ldquo;Secure,&amp;rdquo; and the algorithms that make it work are crazy and wonderful. To understand why HTTPS is so magical, let&amp;rsquo;s use an analogy.&#xA;Suppose you gather three accomplished programmers: Janice, Natalia, and Mario. These three have never met or communicated in any way.</description>

This is one of the most frustrating things about code: we use it to offload complexity from our brains, but the inverse of this benefit is that any useful program will be too complex for us to wrap our minds around completely.</description>

      <description>What are environments, anyway? Most software companies have their product deployed to a few different environments, which have names like local, dev, test, stage, and production. On my first day as a developer I was confused about why there were so many steps between a developer&amp;rsquo;s computer and the app that customers used. It seemed inefficient and bureaucratic. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to appreciate those environments, though, and these days I break out in an ice-cold sweat if someone talks about deploying straight to production.</description>

      <description>Some background Back in the early 2000s, if you&amp;rsquo;d been working on a Microsoft Word document and shut down your computer without hitting Ctrl+S, you were in a bad spot. All your work was gone and there was no way to get it back. In future versions of Word they introduced an autorecovery tool, which if you were lucky would offer to get most of it back for you. That was nice, but the real game changer was Google Docs, with its always-vigilant Saved indicator, noticing whenever you changed the document and saving it to the cloud automatically every couple of seconds.</description>

      <description>A pretty-darned-optional part of being a software developer is getting a generally-applicable principle (a &amp;ldquo;law&amp;rdquo;) named after yourself. Most of the time, it seems, this happens unintentionally&amp;ndash;the law&amp;rsquo;s originator doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily foresee it becoming a pithy and oft-repeated internet adage. But if I could choose a principle to call &amp;ldquo;Lyman&amp;rsquo;s Law,&amp;rdquo; I think it might be this one:&#xA;Code accompanied by unit tests will have a higher standard of code quality than code written without unit tests, even if the unit tests themselves are not taken into account.</description>
