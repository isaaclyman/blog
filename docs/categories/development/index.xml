      <description>When you start out coding, you usually spend a year or two completely oblivious to the rules of “good code.” You may hear words like “elegant” or “clean” tossed around, but you can’t define them. That’s okay. For a programmer without any experience, there’s only one metric worth keeping tabs on: does it work?

      <description>The company I work for is slowly losing its &amp;ldquo;startup&amp;rdquo; status. I’m trying not to be too nostalgic about it. After all, it means we’re doing well; a slew of truly impressive awards and contracts in recent months means we’re doing great. There’s a lot to be grateful for. At the same time, a lot is changing.
As this transition has played out, we’ve had to upgrade a few things.</description>
