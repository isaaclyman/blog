      <description>Sometime in 2018 (or possibly earlier; the site only lists the date of the last update, not the date of the original post) Daniel Gritzer of Serious Eats posted a recipe for Blistered-Tomato Pasta Salad With Basil. It&amp;rsquo;s very simple: eight ingredients if you count both salt and pepper, just under an hour from start to finish (I know the recipe says 25 minutes, but if you&amp;rsquo;re a normal home cook and not an award-winning chef with a TV show, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to double or triple the estimates given by sites like this).</description>

      <description>I would call this &amp;ldquo;incredible foods you need to eat before you die&amp;rdquo; but that template is overplayed and unnecessarily depressing, in my opinion. Yes, you should eat all of these if you have the chance. No, your life isn&amp;rsquo;t less-than if you don&amp;rsquo;t.
Feel free to leave a comment if I missed one of your favorites.
