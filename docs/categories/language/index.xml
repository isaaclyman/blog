      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning Mandarin over the past two months and it&amp;rsquo;s been one surprise after another. I already speak English and Spanish, two languages that in retrospect are practically twins. Mandarin, on the other hand, comes not just from the opposite side of the globe but from the opposite side of the linguistic universe. As such, it&amp;rsquo;s a special sort of challenge for someone who speaks a Western language.&#xA;Partially to set you up for success in learning Mandarin, and partially to stoke your interest, I want to share some of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about the language.</description>
