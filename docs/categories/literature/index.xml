      <description>While rewatching Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 last night, I was struck by the amount of unsubtle Christianity baked into the film. I have no history with the comics so I can&amp;rsquo;t trace this symbolism to its source as handily as I&amp;rsquo;d like (though I&amp;rsquo;m peripherally aware of Mantis being heralded as the mother-to-be of a &amp;ldquo;Celestial Messiah&amp;rdquo; in the original comic). But I can point out a few things that my liberal arts degree may attune me to sooner than the average movie-goer.</description>
