      <description>Computer processing is the act by which the world of the computer is constructed. We can call it a world because it appears to exist unto itself, persisting its environment and taking scripted actions well outside of our awareness. Modern computers rarely shut off completely, so the illusion of persistence (&amp;ldquo;my user desktop is still there even when my computer is asleep; I just drop in on it now and then&amp;rdquo;) is not entirely an illusion.</description>

      <description>Depth and problematization You can&amp;rsquo;t unthink a thought. I&amp;rsquo;m speaking of thoughts outside the borders of what we have previously thought about. These thoughts are apt to unsettle us, even consume us for a period of time. Ultimately we will incorporate them into our normal thought patterns and move on, but we will be fundamentally different selves from that point on.
These thoughts often can&amp;rsquo;t be communicated in the same words they were formed with.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;] a man is always prey to his truths. Once he has admitted them, he cannot free himself from them. One has to pay something.
Albert Camus, The Myth of Sisyphus
[&amp;hellip;] success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one&amp;rsquo;s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one&amp;rsquo;s surrender to a person other than oneself.</description>
