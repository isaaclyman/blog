      <description>I’m a white man by birth and a Christian by heritage. I’m also a Democrat (technically unaffiliated, but only as an escape hatch). What’s more, I believe that I’m a Democrat because of my Christian heritage and beliefs, not in spite of them. It’s clear to me that the left side of America’s political divide most closely (albeit imperfectly) embodies the ideals of Judeo-Christian morality.
I feel a need to justify myself in this.</description>
