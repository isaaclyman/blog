      <description>Introduction Edward is a web app designed to help aspiring authors write their first book.
It all started with a really simple question: what if word processors all suck?
Take Microsoft Word, for example. It&amp;rsquo;s a great formatting and layout tool. Remember WordArt? WordArt was fun: if you wanted giant leopard-print 3D words in your document, WordArt had it covered.
But you had to know what you wanted to write with those leopard-print words, and that was your real problem anyway.</description>
