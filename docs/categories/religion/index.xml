      <description>The evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones. So let it be with Caesar.
~ Shakespeare, &amp;ldquo;Julius Caesar&amp;rdquo;
 Grok, if you can, the utter inability of human beings to describe other human beings neutrally. Almost all adjectives, even the most objective, become a value judgment when used to label a person&amp;mdash;words like &amp;ldquo;short&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;plump&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;withdrawn&amp;rdquo; invoke an emotional response in many readers.</description>

      <description>I’m a white man by birth and a Christian by heritage. I’m also a Democrat (technically unaffiliated, but only as an escape hatch). What’s more, I believe that I’m a Democrat because of my Christian heritage and beliefs, not in spite of them. It’s clear to me that the left side of America’s political divide most closely (albeit imperfectly) embodies the ideals of Judeo-Christian morality.
I feel a need to justify myself in this.</description>
