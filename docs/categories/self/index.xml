      <title>Believing vs. performing</title>

      <description>Religion is offended by the literal approach. Believers aren&amp;rsquo;t supposed to ask about the texture or whereabouts of god and heaven, and if they do, the response is most often a patronizing smile and a metaphor. Thus the believer might be forgiven for intuiting religion to be not something you believe, or take to be materially and physically true, but something you do: that is, a performance.&#xA;This is not a very dire insult.</description>

      <description>If you want to succeed at something or be a certain kind of person, what should you do?&#xA;This must be a hard question, since most people get it wrong, at least at first. But we can modify it to make it easier.&#xA;Try this:&#xA;If I were trying to fail, what things would I do?&#xA;Be honest with yourself. Make a list. And then follow it with:&#xA;How many of those things am I currently doing?</description>

      <title>Managing the common cold</title>
      <link>http://isaaclyman.com/blog/posts/cold/</link>

      <description>I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice. Consult your doctor before beginning any new treatment.&#xA;Long story short: when I feel a cold coming on, I do two rituals.&#xA;Twice-daily sinus rinse with saline spray. (e.g. Arm &amp;amp; Hammer Simply Saline) Once-daily zinc drink. (e.g. Emergen-C Immune+ packets, not to be confused with Emergen-C Vitamin C/Daily Immune Support) Neither of these is supported by scientific evidence. They may be placebos.</description>

      <description>I have a beard now. And&amp;hellip;that&amp;rsquo;s everything that&amp;rsquo;s new with me. What&amp;rsquo;s new with you?&#xA;The following is a list of my favorite beard products, after a year of trying a whole lot of different ones. I&amp;rsquo;m not being paid to write this, nor can I be bothered to sign up for some affiliate links, so enjoy—no strings attached.&#xA;For reference, my beard is coarse, dry, and very frizzy.&#xA;Beard comb Beard brushes are good for short beards and the occasional bit of sculpting.</description>

      <description>I turned 30 this year. Here are 15 things I&amp;rsquo;d tell my 15-year-old self if I could.&#xA;Don&amp;rsquo;t take advice from someone you&amp;rsquo;d hate to be like. Someone who gives you advice, even cautionary advice, is recruiting you to be a little more like them. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want that, it&amp;rsquo;s okay to ignore them. Awful people are their own reward. It&amp;rsquo;s okay to stand up for yourself but it&amp;rsquo;s also okay to move on and leave jerks to their misery.</description>

      <title>On forbidden knowledge and transformative thought</title>

      <description>Depth and problematization You can&amp;rsquo;t unthink a thought. I&amp;rsquo;m speaking of thoughts outside the borders of what we have previously thought about. These thoughts are apt to unsettle us, even consume us for a period of time. Ultimately we will incorporate them into our normal thought patterns and move on, but we will be fundamentally different selves from that point on.&#xA;These thoughts often can&amp;rsquo;t be communicated in the same words they were formed with.</description>

      <title>On absurdism, belief, and meaning</title>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;] a man is always prey to his truths. Once he has admitted them, he cannot free himself from them. One has to pay something.&#xA;Albert Camus, The Myth of Sisyphus&#xA;[&amp;hellip;] success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one&amp;rsquo;s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one&amp;rsquo;s surrender to a person other than oneself.</description>

      <title>2005 - 2010: Five stories and an apology</title>

      <description>2005 - 2006 One time in the &amp;rsquo;80s a first grade teacher was mean to my oldest sister. As a result all of us kids were homeschooled until we got old enough to beg our way out.&#xA;I understand that homeschooling is an essential option for some children. I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend it for anyone else.&#xA;Some parents do &amp;ldquo;homeschool groups&amp;rdquo; where their kid spends a lot of time around other kids and does field trips.</description>

      <title>Conversation classes: fighter, bard, tank, healer</title>

      <description>What kind of conversationalist are you? Do you often start the conversation in a group setting? Are you a chatterbox who can talk endlessly about anything at all? Do you wait on the sidelines, occasionally cracking a joke or adding an interesting detail? The answer may be &amp;ldquo;it depends.&amp;rdquo; A lot of us have gotten to where we are by knowing when to listen and when to talk&amp;mdash;and getting fairly good at both.</description>

      <title>On Church</title>

      <description>This is a struggle to write and will be a struggle to publish. It&amp;rsquo;s been sitting in my drafts for over a year now. I have gone back and forth on whether to publish it at all.&#xA;The first reason is that among members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (colloquially, &amp;ldquo;Mormons&amp;rdquo;), there is a sizable faction that would label this &amp;ldquo;anti-Mormon literature.&amp;rdquo; Church members consider anti-Mormon literature a dangerous and insidious poison, such that by simply reading enough of it one&amp;rsquo;s faith can be dissolved and one&amp;rsquo;s eternal prospects can be dashed.</description>
