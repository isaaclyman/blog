      <title>On tools of unusual advantage</title>

      <description>People have an excessive tendency to reason by definition. We want to understand events in terms of principles; we prefer stories to systems; we like brevity more than nuance. When something doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit our framing, most of us close our eyes and fool ourselves that it does.
This underpins the perennial debate of &amp;ldquo;X is good, X is evil.&amp;rdquo; Occasionally the topic, X, is a person, in which case the question is more or less answerable.</description>

      <description>I have a beard now. And&amp;hellip;that&amp;rsquo;s everything that&amp;rsquo;s new with me. What&amp;rsquo;s new with you?
The following is a list of my favorite beard products, after a year of trying a whole lot of different ones. I&amp;rsquo;m not being paid to write this, nor can I be bothered to sign up for some affiliate links, so enjoy—no strings attached.
For reference, my beard is coarse, dry, and very frizzy.
Beard comb Beard brushes are good for short beards and the occasional bit of sculpting.</description>

      <title>Have we reached Peak Programming Languages?</title>

      <description>I’m relatively young on the programming scene (I wasn&amp;rsquo;t around when FORTRAN came out or anything) so this is a hubristic thing to say, but it feels like we’ve reached Peak Programming Languages. For anything you want to build and any way you want to build it, there&amp;rsquo;s a mature and popular language already available. Typically the community around it is robust and the syntax is delightful. I mean, just try writing a few lines of C# or Dart and tell me it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel nice.</description>

      <title>Wordle spinoffs and competitors, ranked</title>

      <description>Wordle took social media by storm in December 2021. The online word game, a spinoff of 1955&amp;rsquo;s Jotto, was addictive, social, and easy to play—perfectly positioned to become an object of mass obsession. By now it&amp;rsquo;s cemented itself as an all-star in a tradition of word games that have been popular across the world for centuries.
In the the year since Wordle&amp;rsquo;s rise to popularity, the simplicity of the game has inspired hundreds of copycats, lookalikes, and twists on the formula, which have blossomed into a new casual gaming culture based on short, daily games and friendly competition on iMessage groups.</description>

      <title>A keyboard is not a list of buttons</title>

      <description>Building a software keyboard is almost always a Bad Idea. The keyboards that come installed with our phones and tablets represent years of institutional knowledge and are fine-tuned for user experience and accessibility. A good keyboard is something you never have to think about, and it takes a significant investment to get there.
However, there are cases where you have no choice but to render your own. For example, in my mobile word game Sootly, each key on the keyboard has an animated, multi-color background representing clues for the puzzle you&amp;rsquo;re solving.</description>

      <description>Your current credit card can be used in four different ways:
Typing in the card number. We&amp;rsquo;ve been using credit cards this way since 1950. Sliding the card&amp;rsquo;s magnetic strip (the black stripe) through a card reader. This method was invented by IBM in the 1960s and has been in use ever since, but it&amp;rsquo;s on its way out. In a few short years many credit cards will no longer have a magnetic strip.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all seen this one, right?
&amp;ldquo;As a user, I want to log in to the app.&amp;rdquo;
That&amp;rsquo;s a lie. And not just a little one—a whopper. Logging in isn&amp;rsquo;t on anyone&amp;rsquo;s to-do list. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t put anyone closer to their goals. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t create value and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide a service. Logging in, like locking your front door, isn&amp;rsquo;t something you want to do. It&amp;rsquo;s something you&amp;rsquo;re haplessly forced to do because there&amp;rsquo;s no safe alternative.</description>

      <title>Is code a performative speech act?</title>

      <description>Computer processing is the act by which the world of the computer is constructed. We can call it a world because it appears to exist unto itself, persisting its environment and taking scripted actions well outside of our awareness. Modern computers rarely shut off completely, so the illusion of persistence (&amp;ldquo;my user desktop is still there even when my computer is asleep; I just drop in on it now and then&amp;rdquo;) is not entirely an illusion.</description>

      <description>I turned 30 this year. Here are 15 things I&amp;rsquo;d tell my 15-year-old self if I could.
Don&amp;rsquo;t take advice from someone you&amp;rsquo;d hate to be like. Someone who gives you advice, even cautionary advice, is recruiting you to be a little more like them. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want that, it&amp;rsquo;s okay to ignore them. Awful people are their own reward. It&amp;rsquo;s okay to stand up for yourself but it&amp;rsquo;s also okay to move on and leave jerks to their misery.</description>

      <title>C#: Equality overrides, hash codes, and dictionaries</title>

      <description>Consider the following C# class:
class StringEquivalent { private string Value { get; } public StringEquivalent(string value) { Value = value; } public override string ToString() { return Value; } public override bool Equals(object obj) { if (obj == null) { return false; } return obj.ToString() == Value; } public override int GetHashCode() { return Value.GetHashCode(); } } You provide a string when you instantiate it and you can compare it with another instance or a string using the Equals override (I&amp;rsquo;m using LINQPad&amp;rsquo;s Dump() method to test it):</description>

      <title>On forbidden knowledge and transformative thought</title>

      <description>Depth and problematization You can&amp;rsquo;t unthink a thought. I&amp;rsquo;m speaking of thoughts outside the borders of what we have previously thought about. These thoughts are apt to unsettle us, even consume us for a period of time. Ultimately we will incorporate them into our normal thought patterns and move on, but we will be fundamentally different selves from that point on.
These thoughts often can&amp;rsquo;t be communicated in the same words they were formed with.</description>

      <title>YAML Pipelines in Azure DevOps: tips and advice</title>

      <guid>http://isaaclyman.com/blog/posts/ado-yaml-pipelines/</guid>
      <description>Classic pipelines are out, YAML pipelines are in. Azure DevOps (ADO) has adopted a pipelines-as-code philosophy that will be their build and release strategy for the foreseeable future. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to appreciate about the new pipelines, though they are a bit of a mental adjustment and the transition is anything but automatic&amp;mdash;I took a few weeks converting all of ours, though there were some special obstacles in our case that hopefully you won&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with.</description>

      <title>Leadership and motivation</title>

      <guid>http://isaaclyman.com/blog/posts/what-people-hear/</guid>
      <description>One of the core hard things about leadership is that people hear what they are, not what you say.
When you say “let’s work hard and get this done,” you’re probably hoping to light a fire under the easygoing or underachieving members of the team, but only the anxious, hardworking folks who are already at risk for burnout will hear you. And when you say “but pace yourself and take breaks” you’re hoping to bring the overachievers down a notch but that won&amp;rsquo;t work; laid-back people will take this as a cue to lay back even more and their anxious teammates will try to pick up the slack.</description>

      <description>Application streaming is one of the emerging technologies I&amp;rsquo;m most bullish on. So far its full potential has flown under the radar, but there are companies doing impressive things with it:
Xbox Cloud Gaming, currently in beta, streams Xbox games from cloud servers with low latency even on an LTE connection. It&amp;rsquo;s powered by Rainway, whose streaming offering has pivoted from video games to fully-interactive streamed apps of every kind. Google Stadia is a similar service with a library of games you can buy and then play exclusively through the cloud.</description>

      <title>The hallmarks of bad poetry</title>

      <guid>http://isaaclyman.com/blog/posts/bad-poetry/</guid>
      <description>Most people misunderstand what poetry is for. If someone you know from church or work shares a poem they wrote, you almost have to start cringing before you read it lest you be overwhelmed by the artlessness of the first stanza and die suddenly. You already know the poetic form is going to be an excuse for them to overshare, get weepy, commit crimes against the English language, or string together clichés as if they were profound.</description>

      <description>Sometime in 2018 (or possibly earlier; the site only lists the date of the last update, not the date of the original post) Daniel Gritzer of Serious Eats posted a recipe for Blistered-Tomato Pasta Salad With Basil. It&amp;rsquo;s very simple: eight ingredients if you count both salt and pepper, just under an hour from start to finish (I know the recipe says 25 minutes, but if you&amp;rsquo;re a normal home cook and not an award-winning chef with a TV show, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to double or triple the estimates given by sites like this).</description>

      <description>Following are the questions I see most frequently on r/adhd and several ADHD-focused Facebook groups I&amp;rsquo;m part of. For each, I&amp;rsquo;ve provided an answer that aligns with the community consensus or the latest scientific research.
I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice. Consult a doctor before beginning any new treatment.
Do I really have ADHD or am I just lazy? My parent/sibling/professor/doctor says ADHD isn&amp;rsquo;t real. Are they right?</description>

      <description>During the recent Joe Rogan backlash I decided to cast a vote with my wallet and end my Spotify subscription. This concluded a nearly decade-long relationship between Spotify and me; I was one of their first North American users. I vividly remember having to snipe an invite code from page 7 of a forum thread back in 2011 so I could join the U.S. beta.
2011-era Spotify was pretty fantastic. The UX was really smooth.</description>

      <description>Central nervous system stimulants such as Adderall, Ritalin, and Vyvanse are commonly used to treat ADHD and narcolepsy in children and adults. Common side effects of these drugs are increased blood pressure and heart rate. Anecdotally, many patients and doctors assume that there are negative long-term heart consequences for stimulant use, even when taken as prescribed and in approved doses. The purpose of this article is to review the available research and determine if this concern is supported by the evidence.</description>

      <description>I love puzzle games. I&amp;rsquo;m not always good at them, but I love them.
I have yet to see the rules or expectations of puzzle games enumerated as such, so here are what I believe to be the basics.
Each puzzle must have a single unique solution. The correct solution must be discoverable by pure logic and elimination. The solve must include multiple interrelated pieces or steps. Multiple non-computerized strategies must be available to the player, though they need not be disclosed by the puzzle&amp;rsquo;s creator.</description>

      <description>The search for the lost AirPod My wife Dylan is a math and physics teacher. Yesterday while she was on a Zoom call with a student I got a text message from her: &amp;ldquo;the kids have my AirPods.&amp;rdquo; She knew because her student was cracking up laughing at the babblings of our toddlers, captured by the built-in microphone on the AirPods.
I tracked down the kids. They were carrying around an AirPod case with one AirPod in it.</description>

Albert Camus, The Myth of Sisyphus
[&amp;hellip;] success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one&amp;rsquo;s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one&amp;rsquo;s surrender to a person other than oneself.</description>

      <description>2005 - 2006 One time in the &amp;rsquo;80s a first grade teacher was mean to my oldest sister. As a result all of us kids were homeschooled until we got old enough to beg our way out.
I understand that homeschooling is an essential option for some children. I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend it for anyone else.
Some parents do &amp;ldquo;homeschool groups&amp;rdquo; where their kid spends a lot of time around other kids and does field trips.</description>

      <description>The New Year is coming up. Some of you are about to make harmful, unscientific, doomed resolutions, treating your body like Intel treats a microchip&amp;mdash;that is, trying to make it smaller and smaller year after year.
In Western society, pervasive messages about body size teach us that being small means being worthy, healthy, desirable, motivated, in control; and that being large means being lazy, sick, stupid, secondary, an eyesore. All of these things are false.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about one of my favorite .NET features.
IEnumerable is an interface for iterating over a collection. In other words, if something is an IEnumerable, you can mostly think of it like an Array or a List. You can use a foreach statement to loop through it, you can use LINQ to map or reduce it in a hundred different ways, or you can explicitly cast it to an array with .</description>

      <description>Technical recruiters have an extraordinarily difficult job. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that in 2020 there were about two million people working in programming jobs across a few different categories. They also project that software developer employment will grow 22% by 2030, nearly three times the average rate for all occupations. And in 2019, IT trade group CompTIA reported a staggering 918,000 unfilled IT jobs over a period of three months.</description>

      <description>What kind of conversationalist are you? Do you often start the conversation in a group setting? Are you a chatterbox who can talk endlessly about anything at all? Do you wait on the sidelines, occasionally cracking a joke or adding an interesting detail? The answer may be &amp;ldquo;it depends.&amp;rdquo; A lot of us have gotten to where we are by knowing when to listen and when to talk&amp;mdash;and getting fairly good at both.</description>

      <description>This is a struggle to write and will be a struggle to publish. It&amp;rsquo;s been sitting in my drafts for over a year now. I have gone back and forth on whether to publish it at all.
The first reason is that among members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (colloquially, &amp;ldquo;Mormons&amp;rdquo;), there is a sizable faction that would label this &amp;ldquo;anti-Mormon literature.&amp;rdquo; Church members consider anti-Mormon literature a dangerous and insidious poison, such that by simply reading enough of it one&amp;rsquo;s faith can be dissolved and one&amp;rsquo;s eternal prospects can be dashed.</description>

      <title>4 things everyone should know about ADHD</title>

      <description>I am not a doctor and this does not constitute medical advice. Consult your physician before making any decision that could affect your health.
I was diagnosed with ADHD this year. Frankly, the diagnosis blindsided me. On the advice of my therapist I had gone in to get tested for Autism Spectrum Disorder. We thought it might explain some of my difficulties in daily life and social interactions, and knowing about it would help me self-educate and thereby address it more effectively.</description>

      <title>The most incredible things I&#39;ve ever eaten</title>
      <link>http://isaaclyman.com/blog/posts/mind-blowing-food/</link>

      <description>I would call this &amp;ldquo;incredible foods you need to eat before you die&amp;rdquo; but that template is overplayed and unnecessarily depressing, in my opinion. Yes, you should eat all of these if you have the chance. No, your life isn&amp;rsquo;t less-than if you don&amp;rsquo;t.
Feel free to leave a comment if I missed one of your favorites.

      <title>Some things to know before you learn Mandarin Chinese</title>
      <link>http://isaaclyman.com/blog/posts/things-to-know-chinese/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning Mandarin over the past two months and it&amp;rsquo;s been one surprise after another. I already speak English and Spanish, two languages that in retrospect are practically twins. Mandarin, on the other hand, comes not just from the opposite side of the globe but from the opposite side of the linguistic universe. As such, it&amp;rsquo;s a special sort of challenge for someone who speaks a Western language.
Partially to set you up for success in learning Mandarin, and partially to stoke your interest, I want to share some of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about the language.</description>

      <description>Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to go from 0 to a configurable load testing script using JMeter, a free and popular load testing tool. We&amp;rsquo;ll be moving quickly, so hold on tight.
What is load testing? If your app or service is very successful, hundreds of people might be using it at once. Lots of things can go wrong when a server is under heavy usage like that. It&amp;rsquo;s not economical to recruit hundreds of actual people to test your app manually, so your best choice is to use software to simulate it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve eaten a lot of bottom-tier burgers in my life and I&amp;rsquo;ve heartily enjoyed most of them. Neighborhood cookouts, college parties, church functions, fast food joints: throughout my life, bad burgers have been a mainstay of the public spaces I frequent. And if the suburban United States is home to you, you know exactly what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. A soft grocery-store bun; an iPhone-thin patty of bland, meat-like grind, cooked well-done on a gas grill; a pasty, out-of-season tomato slice; a rag of wilted lettuce; a few strings of raw onion; and a splotch of lukewarm ketchup and mustard.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing a book: a complete guide to your first year as a developer. And I&amp;rsquo;m looking for co-authors.
It&amp;rsquo;s not a technical manual about Python or Kubernetes or Angular. And it&amp;rsquo;s not a deep-dive about refactoring or craftsmanship. It&amp;rsquo;s a guide to the other stuff: resume writing, getting that first job, ethics, career progression, what to do when you&amp;rsquo;re stuck.
The book will be pay-what-you-want (minimum price of free).</description>

We don&amp;rsquo;t hire junior developers or interns&amp;hellip;if you don&amp;rsquo;t get a puppy, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to clean up its messes.

I&amp;rsquo;m flabbergasted that some corporate schmuck figured out a way to cast puppies in a negative light and people kept listening. I mean, puppies are the purest beings on planet Earth.</description>

      <description>Most people are familiar with the http:// that begins web site URLs. And some may have noticed that any website with a login form or sensitive information starts with https:// instead. The &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; stands for &amp;ldquo;Secure,&amp;rdquo; and the algorithms that make it work are crazy and wonderful. To understand why HTTPS is so magical, let&amp;rsquo;s use an analogy.
Suppose you gather three accomplished programmers: Janice, Natalia, and Mario. These three have never met or communicated in any way.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re a software engineer living in Idaho. You wake up with the sun at 2PM, Greenwich Mean Time, which everyone just calls &amp;ldquo;UN Time&amp;rdquo; since the United Nations adopted it as the universal time standard a few years ago. Soon nobody will call it anything. That&amp;rsquo;ll just be what time it is. Regardless of whether you&amp;rsquo;re in Idaho, DC, Ireland, Nepal or New Zealand, all the clocks will say 2:00 PM at the same time.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a strong business case&amp;mdash;a financially sound, common-sense case&amp;mdash;for acquiring tech talent such as developers, designers, product managers, and QA engineers using quality-of-life values instead of competing on compensation. Conversations about this topic have been taking place in online developer communities for years, but it seems these ideas haven&amp;rsquo;t penetrated the larger tech and business world. If you read on, you&amp;rsquo;ll find there&amp;rsquo;s a wealth of compelling evidence in favor of offering shorter workdays and remote options to your employees as a hiring and loyalty incentive, rather than trying to out-pay the market.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice. Before starting a business, you should consult your own lawyer.
We developers are uniquely positioned to start our own companies. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to downplay the importance of managers, accountants, salespeople, and everyone else who makes a business come together, but devs bring something very rare to the table: the ability to call forth an entire high-value product from the abyss, using no raw materials whatsoever.</description>

      <description>Sometimes when people think I&amp;rsquo;ve done a good thing, they&amp;rsquo;ll say something like &amp;ldquo;you must have wonderful parents,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;ve been raised well.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m against this kind of statement for two reasons.
1 It submits that the worth of my parents&amp;rsquo; sacrifices can be measured by the way I turned out. This is unfair to them. If I had turned out to be a bad person, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t change the value of what they did; obviously I can&amp;rsquo;t invalidate their efforts by intentionally becoming a failure.</description>

      <description>A slogan I hear often in Utah is
Equal opportunity, not equal outcomes.
The Beehive State sees itself as a paradise of the American dream. There&amp;rsquo;s very little regulation, a strong preference for businesses over people, and a limited interest in welfare programs outside of Salt Lake City. When people parrot this slogan, they think they&amp;rsquo;re saying &amp;ldquo;if you work hard, you can succeed; if you&amp;rsquo;re lazy, no one&amp;rsquo;s going to give you a free ride.</description>

Part of a programmer&amp;rsquo;s job is chasing down missing semicolons and complex caching issues, scrutinizing and head-scratching over every line of code in an application. This is one of the most frustrating things about code: we use it to offload complexity from our brains, but the inverse of this benefit is that any useful program will be too complex for us to wrap our minds around completely.</description>

      <description>What are environments, anyway? Most software companies have their product deployed to a few different environments, which have names like local, dev, test, stage, and production. On my first day as a developer I was confused about why there were so many steps between a developer&amp;rsquo;s computer and the app that customers used. It seemed inefficient and bureaucratic. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to appreciate those environments, though, and these days I break out in an ice-cold sweat if someone talks about deploying straight to production.</description>

      <description>Some background Back in the early 2000s, if you&amp;rsquo;d been working on a Microsoft Word document and shut down your computer without hitting Ctrl+S, you were in a bad spot. All your work was gone and there was no way to get it back. In future versions of Word they introduced an autorecovery tool, which if you were lucky would offer to get most of it back for you. That was nice, but the real game changer was Google Docs, with its always-vigilant Saved indicator, noticing whenever you changed the document and saving it to the cloud automatically every couple of seconds.</description>

This post will introduce you to Edward&amp;rsquo;s major features.
Edward has these main pages:

      <description>Introduction Edward is a web app designed to help aspiring authors write their first novel.
It all started with a simple question: what if word processors are the worst possible apps for writing novels?
Take Microsoft Word, for example. It has a lot of formatting and layout tools. Bold, italic, multiple columns, 3D leopard-print text, it&amp;rsquo;s all included.
But you have to know what you want to write with those 3D words, and that&amp;rsquo;s your real problem anyway.</description>

      <description>Most people follow the Waterfall development methodology when building a new habit:
Determine the end goal and deadline (e.g. I will lose 40 pounds by 2019). Write the goal down. Design the habits that will lead up to that goal (e.g. I will stop eating anything that tastes good, and I will exercise five times a week). Assemble the necessary motivations (e.g. accountability buddy, FitBit, bathroom scale, gym membership, workout routine, diet plan).</description>

      <description>A pretty-darned-optional part of being a software developer is getting a generally-applicable principle (a &amp;ldquo;law&amp;rdquo;) named after yourself. Most of the time, it seems, this happens unintentionally&amp;ndash;the law&amp;rsquo;s originator doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily foresee it becoming a pithy and oft-repeated internet adage. But if I could choose a principle to call &amp;ldquo;Lyman&amp;rsquo;s Law,&amp;rdquo; I think it might be this one:
Code accompanied by unit tests will have a higher standard of code quality than code written without unit tests, even if the unit tests themselves are not taken into account.</description>

There are 24 criteria under six categories. I would consider any company that scores positively on 12 or more of these criteria to be “a good place to work.” I have my doubts about whether any existing company could achieve a perfect score, so please don’t take it personally if your company comes up short in multiple areas.</description>

      <description>Problem The patient has a broken leg.
Solution Ask the patient to reproduce the exact scenario that resulted in the broken leg. Watch closely to see if the leg breaks again.

Ask the patient if, all things considered, he really wants to prioritize his broken leg over your other work.</description>
