      <title>The 24 most incredible things I&#39;ve ever eaten</title>

      <description>I would call this &amp;ldquo;24 incredible foods you need to eat before you die&amp;rdquo; but that template is overplayed and unnecessarily depressing, in my opinion. Yes, you should eat all of these if you have the chance. No, your life isn&amp;rsquo;t less-than if you don&amp;rsquo;t.
Feel free to leave a comment if I missed one of your favorites.

      <title>Some things to know before you learn Mandarin Chinese</title>
      <link>http://isaaclyman.com/blog/posts/things-to-know-chinese/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning Mandarin over the past two months and it&amp;rsquo;s been one surprise after another. I already speak English and Spanish, two languages that in retrospect are practically twins. Mandarin, on the other hand, comes not just from the opposite side of the globe but from the opposite side of the linguistic universe. As such, it&amp;rsquo;s a special sort of challenge for someone who speaks a Western language.</description>

      <title>Load testing with Jmeter: an introduction</title>

      <description>Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to go from 0 to a configurable load testing script using JMeter, a free and popular load testing tool. We&amp;rsquo;ll be moving quickly, so hold on tight.
What is load testing? If your app or service is very successful, hundreds of people might be using it at once. Lots of things can go wrong when a server is under heavy usage like that. It&amp;rsquo;s not economical to recruit hundreds of actual people to test your app manually, so your best choice is to use software to simulate it.</description>

      <title>The 10 burger commandments</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve eaten a lot of bottom-tier burgers in my life and I&amp;rsquo;ve heartily enjoyed most of them. Neighborhood cookouts, college parties, church functions, fast food joints: throughout my life, bad burgers have been a mainstay of the public spaces I frequent. And if the suburban United States is home to you, you know exactly what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. A soft grocery-store bun; an iPhone-thin patty of bland, meat-like grind, cooked well-done on a gas grill; a pasty, out-of-season tomato slice; a rag of wilted lettuce; a few strings of raw onion; and a splotch of lukewarm ketchup and mustard.</description>

      <title>Christian symbolism in Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2</title>

      <description>While rewatching Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 last night, I was struck by the amount of unsubtle Christianity baked into the film. I have no history with the comics so I can&amp;rsquo;t trace this symbolism to its source as handily as I&amp;rsquo;d like (though I&amp;rsquo;m peripherally aware of Mantis being heralded as the mother-to-be of a &amp;ldquo;Celestial Messiah&amp;rdquo; in the original comic). But I can point out a few things that my liberal arts degree may attune me to sooner than the average movie-goer.</description>

      <guid>http://isaaclyman.com/blog/posts/im-writing-a-book/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing a book: a complete guide to your first year as a developer. And I&amp;rsquo;m looking for co-authors.
It&amp;rsquo;s not a technical manual about Python or Kubernetes or Angular. And it&amp;rsquo;s not a deep-dive about refactoring or craftsmanship. It&amp;rsquo;s a guide to the other stuff: resume writing, getting that first job, ethics, career progression, what to do when you&amp;rsquo;re stuck.
The book will be pay-what-you-want (minimum price of free).</description>

I occasionally get a message from a brand-new developer who&amp;rsquo;s overwhelmed by all the technologies and choices that exist in the world of software development. Where do you even start? Some of these devs have seen job advertisements like the following:</description>

      <description>Let me tell you the story of a very successful company that made a very big, dumb decision.
 We don&amp;rsquo;t hire junior developers or interns&amp;hellip;if you don&amp;rsquo;t get a puppy, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to clean up its messes.
~ Netflix
 I&amp;rsquo;m flabbergasted that some corporate schmuck figured out a way to cast puppies in a negative light and people kept listening. I mean, puppies are the purest beings on planet Earth.</description>

      <description>Most people are familiar with the http:// that begins web site URLs. And some may have noticed that any website with a login form or sensitive information starts with https:// instead. The &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; stands for &amp;ldquo;Secure,&amp;rdquo; and the algorithms that make it work are crazy and wonderful. To understand why HTTPS is so magical, let&amp;rsquo;s use an analogy.
Suppose you gather three accomplished programmers: Janice, Natalia, and Mario. These three have never met or communicated in any way.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re a software engineer living in Idaho. You wake up with the sun at 2PM, Greenwich Mean Time, which everyone just calls &amp;ldquo;UN Time&amp;rdquo; since the United Nations adopted it as the universal time standard a few years ago. Soon nobody will call it anything. That&amp;rsquo;ll just be what time it is. Regardless of whether you&amp;rsquo;re in Idaho, DC, Ireland, Nepal or New Zealand, all the clocks will say 2:00 PM at the same time.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a strong business case&amp;mdash;a financially sound, common-sense case&amp;mdash;for acquiring tech talent such as developers, designers, product managers, and QA engineers using quality-of-life values instead of competing on compensation. Conversations about this topic have been taking place in online developer communities for years, but it seems these ideas haven&amp;rsquo;t penetrated the larger tech and business world. If you read on, you&amp;rsquo;ll find there&amp;rsquo;s a wealth of compelling evidence in favor of offering shorter workdays and remote options to your employees as a hiring and loyalty incentive, rather than trying to out-pay the market.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice. Before starting a business, you should consult your own lawyer.
We developers are uniquely positioned to start our own companies. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to downplay the importance of managers, accountants, salespeople, and everyone else who makes a business come together, but devs bring something very rare to the table: the ability to call forth an entire high-value product from the abyss, using no raw materials whatsoever.</description>

      <description>Sometimes when people think I&amp;rsquo;ve done a good thing, they&amp;rsquo;ll say something like &amp;ldquo;you must have wonderful parents,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;ve been raised well.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m against this kind of statement for two reasons.
1 It submits that the worth of my parents&amp;rsquo; sacrifices can be measured by the way I turned out. This is unfair to them. If I had turned out to be a bad person, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t change the value of what they did; obviously I can&amp;rsquo;t invalidate their efforts by intentionally becoming a failure.</description>

      <description>A slogan I hear often in Utah is
 Equal opportunity, not equal outcomes.
 The Beehive State sees itself as a paradise of the American dream. There&amp;rsquo;s very little regulation, a strong preference for businesses over people, and a limited interest in welfare programs outside of Salt Lake City. When people parrot this slogan, they think they&amp;rsquo;re saying &amp;ldquo;if you work hard, you can succeed; if you&amp;rsquo;re lazy, no one&amp;rsquo;s going to give you a free ride.</description>

Part of a programmer&amp;rsquo;s job is chasing down missing semicolons and complex caching issues, scrutinizing and head-scratching over every line of code in an application. This is one of the most frustrating things about code: we use it to offload complexity from our brains, but the inverse of this benefit is that any useful program will be too complex for us to wrap our minds around completely.</description>

      <description>What are environments, anyway? Most software companies have their product deployed to a few different environments, which have names like local, dev, test, stage, and production. On my first day as a developer I was confused about why there were so many steps between a developer&amp;rsquo;s computer and the app that customers used. It seemed inefficient and bureaucratic. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to appreciate those environments, though, and these days I break out in an ice-cold sweat if someone talks about deploying straight to production.</description>

      <description>Some background Back in the early 2000s, if you&amp;rsquo;d been working on a Microsoft Word document and shut down your computer without hitting Ctrl+S, you were in a bad spot. All your work was gone and there was no way to get it back. In future versions of Word they introduced an autorecovery tool, which if you were lucky would offer to get most of it back for you. That was nice, but the real game changer was Google Docs, with its always-vigilant Saved indicator, noticing whenever you changed the document and saving it to the cloud automatically every couple of seconds.</description>

I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it at the time, but there&amp;rsquo;s only one reason I never got shot by a stranger in high school: luck. And I hope that everyone I know has the same luck.

I feel very privileged to lead the life I lead. I live in a good neighborhood. I can change jobs if I don&amp;rsquo;t like the one I have. I haven&amp;rsquo;t worried about how to pay for groceries since 2013.

~ Shakespeare, &amp;ldquo;Julius Caesar&amp;rdquo;
 Grok, if you can, the utter inability of human beings to describe other human beings neutrally. Almost all adjectives, even the most objective, become a value judgment when used to label a person&amp;mdash;words like &amp;ldquo;short&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;plump&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;withdrawn&amp;rdquo; invoke an emotional response in many readers.</description>

      <description>Introduction Edward is a web app designed to help aspiring authors write their first novel.
It all started with a simple question: what if word processors are the worst possible apps for writing novels?
Take Microsoft Word, for example. It has a lot of formatting and layout tools. Bold, italic, multiple columns, 3D leopard-print text, it&amp;rsquo;s all included.
But you have to know what you want to write with those 3D words, and that&amp;rsquo;s your real problem anyway.</description>

      <description>Most people follow the Waterfall development methodology when building a new habit:
 Determine the end goal and deadline (e.g. I will lose 40 pounds by 2019). Write the goal down. Design the habits that will lead up to that goal (e.g. I will stop eating anything that tastes good, and I will exercise five times a week). Assemble the necessary motivations (e.g. accountability buddy, FitBit, bathroom scale, gym membership, workout routine, diet plan).</description>

      <description>A pretty-darned-optional part of being a software developer is getting a generally-applicable principle (a &amp;ldquo;law&amp;rdquo;) named after yourself. Most of the time, it seems, this happens unintentionally&amp;ndash;the law&amp;rsquo;s originator doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily foresee it becoming a pithy and oft-repeated internet adage. But if I could choose a principle to call &amp;ldquo;Lyman&amp;rsquo;s Law,&amp;rdquo; I think it might be this one:
 Code accompanied by unit tests will have a higher standard of code quality than code written without unit tests, even if the unit tests themselves are not taken into account.</description>

      <description>Iâve created this system for rating technology companies based on the way they conduct business, their place in the community and how they treat their developers. Itâs a work in progress and I welcome your commentary.
There are 24 criteria under six categories. I would consider any company that scores positively on 12 or more of these criteria to be âa good place to work.â I have my doubts about whether any existing company could achieve a perfect score, so please donât take it personally if your company comes up short in multiple areas.</description>

Are you a coder, programmer, developer, engineer, architect or something else? My first job was an underage, under-the-table weekend gig at a pizza parlor. Iâd show up at the local strip mall early Saturday morning, stash my bike, and clock in.</description>

      <description>In every community thereâs a coming-of-age process, a rite of passage that every newcomer must experience before he or she can really be considered an insider. For the CSS community, it goes something like this:
 Hey, this page is almost perfect. Can you just center that icon vertically? I told the boss we can roll it live in five minutes.
 For CSS junkies like me, lines like this provoke an involuntary nervous giggle, the kind of giggle youâll hear if I tell you about the first time I got dumped or crashed my car.</description>

      <description>Problem The patient has a broken leg.
Solution  Ask the patient to reproduce the exact scenario that resulted in the broken leg. Watch closely to see if the leg breaks again. Check for consistency by repeating the scenario a few more times. Explain that this isnât an intended use case for the leg, and besides, it only affects one person. Ask the patient if, all things considered, he really wants to prioritize his broken leg over your other work.</description>

      <description>Iâm a white man by birth and a Christian by heritage. Iâm also a Democrat (technically unaffiliated, but only as an escape hatch). Whatâs more, I believe that Iâm a Democrat because of my Christian heritage and beliefs, not in spite of them. Itâs clear to me that the left side of Americaâs political divide most closely (albeit imperfectly) embodies the ideals of Judeo-Christian morality.
I feel a need to justify myself in this.</description>
