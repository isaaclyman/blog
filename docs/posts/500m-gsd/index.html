    <div class='entry-content'>
  <p>Since April, our family has put over 500 miles (800 km) on our Tern GSD S10.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>
<p>An electric (<a href="https://isaaclyman.com/blog/posts/ebikes/#class-1-2-and-3">class 1</a>) long-tail cargo bike with 60 miles (96 km) of maximum range per battery slot, about 360 pounds (163 kg) of rider+cargo capacity, and plenty of attachment points for accessories and add-ons.</p>
<h2 id="about-us">About us</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m 78 inches tall (198 cm) and my wife is 64 inches tall (162 cm). We have two kids who aren&rsquo;t yet old enough to ride a bike without training wheels.</p>
<p>Prior to this, we&rsquo;ve never owned a bike that could transport cargo or children.</p>
<h2 id="our-setup">Our setup</h2>
<p>We added a Clubhouse+ back seat, Lockstand Extensions, and a Hauler front rack with a cheap milk crate zip-tied to it.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p><em>They thought of everything.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Incredibly comfortable; useful; resizes quickly; strong and steady</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Shifter tends to get loose over time; some inessential parts are prone to damage</p>
<p><strong>Compromises:</strong> Not cut out for racing or distance biking; too heavy for some bike racks; price of entry may cause hesitation</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-compare">How does it compare?</h2>
<p>The GSD can accommodate multiple riding postures thanks to the quick-resize seat and handlebars, but it seems to want to be a Dutch-style upright city bike. That is, you&rsquo;ll probably ride it in a natural sitting position rather than hunched forward like someone studying a bug. It may be a small thing, but it really lowers the &ldquo;fanatic factor&rdquo;—you don&rsquo;t need to be a dedicated biker, or even in shape at all, to hop on the bike and get around.</p>
<p>The GSD&rsquo;s design philosophy seems to be that anyone—regardless of size, fitness, toolset, or lifestyle—should be able to use it as a car replacement, and they shouldn&rsquo;t have to think very hard about it. That&rsquo;s the pitch. <em>This isn&rsquo;t a bike for bikers. It&rsquo;s an affordable yet premium mini-car for drivers.</em></p>
<p>So how does it compare to our car?</p>
<p>It has less cargo capacity (it&rsquo;s a bike). It&rsquo;s no good for 200-mile road trips. And bike infrastructure is make-or-break—in the suburb where we live, there are several places we can&rsquo;t safely go without driving. So, unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t get rid of the family car just yet.</p>
<p>But for a lot of trips, the GSD is just as good as our hatchback sedan. We use it to take the kids to school, pick up groceries, visit the park and swimming pool, and go on occasional joyrides—uphill or downhill, rain or shine, day or night, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter. It may be slower than the car, but it&rsquo;s more fun. It may not have air conditioning, but it has sunshine and a gentle breeze. It may take more effort to drive, but the exercise is a plus, and the e-assist keeps us from getting too spent.</p>
<p>A lot of people ask us if we feel safe riding around with the kids on the back. In short, yes. The bike frame is very rigid and we&rsquo;ve never fishtailed, even in strong winds. We might feel different out on the highway—we stick to neighborhood roads and bike paths—but I have a low risk tolerance and I&rsquo;ve never felt very nervous.</p>
<p>As for complaints, I&rsquo;m reduced to mere nitpicks. The shifter loosened up a lot during our first few weeks with the bike, leading to some &ldquo;dead gears,&rdquo; but the bike shop easily fixed it during our first tuneup. It&rsquo;s getting a bit loose again, so we either need to look up a how-to video or take it in for another service. Not a big deal either way—tuneups are quick.</p>
<p>I also damaged the plastic chain cover while getting the bike into and out of my car. I only noticed because of a grinding sound while pedaling. On inspection, the bottom of the cover had been bent inward and was rubbing against the cassette. I was able to bend it back out with a wrench.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to find anything else to gripe about. The design prioritizes comfort at the expense of efficiency, but I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s the right move. This bike was never meant to do the Tour de France or take you backpacking. It&rsquo;s practical to the bone—not a sports car, not a Jeep, but a minivan.</p>
<p>Note that you&rsquo;ll probably need a trailer hitch if you want to drive the GSD around. It weighs 75 pounds (35 kg) out of the box, and attachments run that number up a bit more. It&rsquo;s also fairly long and wide, despite its much-advertised compact wheelbase—don&rsquo;t plan on fitting it in your SUV.</p>
<p>And the price? Well, you won&rsquo;t catch me complaining about it. It costs less than the average car accident. It also doesn&rsquo;t use any gas, maintenance is dirt cheap, and the physical and mental health benefits are priceless. More than once I&rsquo;ve wondered if we should have bought the upgraded version with a belt drive, so I wouldn&rsquo;t even have to oil the chain every 100 miles. But overall the whole family agrees: worth every penny.</p>
