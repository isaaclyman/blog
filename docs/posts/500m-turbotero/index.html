    <div class='entry-content'>
  <p>Since July of last year, I&rsquo;ve put over 500 miles (800 km) on my Specialized Turbo Tero X 4.0.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>
<p>An electric (<a href="https://isaaclyman.com/blog/posts/ebikes/#class-1-2-and-3">class 3</a>) hybrid bike with 68 miles (109 km) of maximum range, 300 pounds (136 kg) of rider+cargo capacity, full front and back suspension, and a dropper seatpost.</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m 78 inches tall (198 cm, mostly torso) and weigh 270 pounds (122 kg).</p>
<h2 id="my-setup">My setup</h2>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> XL</p>
<p><strong>Wheel Size:</strong> 29 / 27.5 inch mullet setup</p>
<p>I swapped in DEITY HIGHSIDE handlebars and Ergon GP5 grips for a more comfortable ride. The stock handlebars were too low and made my wrists hurt.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s a tank.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Feels indestructible; shifters and dropper post are responsive and satisfying to use; pedal assist is smooth, natural, and easy to customize with the app; front headlight angle is easily adjusted while riding</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Battery is shockingly difficult to remove; rubber ring around battery cavity doesn&rsquo;t stay put; limited mount points for a bottle cage; front fender gets misaligned easily and rubs on the tire; battery whines during charging</p>
<p><strong>Compromises:</strong> Big and heavy (good for riders like me, but may not be for everyone); some features require logging into an app, though I rode for several months without it and it wasn&rsquo;t a problem</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-compare">How does it compare?</h2>
<p>The Turbo Tero X 4.0 is a &ldquo;keeping my options open&rdquo; kind of bike. It has all the features you&rsquo;d want for a rough mountain trail, but most of my mileage has been on paved bike paths, and it hasn&rsquo;t given me too much to complain about there either. It&rsquo;s not as efficient as a superlight road bike—it certainly feels sluggish without the motor—but when you want to cut through gravel or dirt, there&rsquo;s no comparison. The Tero is a beast.</p>
<p>That said, I sometimes wish I&rsquo;d gone with a gravel bike. It&rsquo;s not so much that there&rsquo;s something wrong with the Tero; for as many things as it tries to be, it does a solid job. It&rsquo;s just that I don&rsquo;t go offroad very often and a lighter profile would be nice on long rides. I&rsquo;m the guy with a Jeep Wrangler thinking maybe he should&rsquo;ve gotten a Subaru Crosstrek for the gas mileage. Some of us have <em>real</em> problems, eh?</p>
<p>The only complaint I can lay squarely at Specialized&rsquo;s feet is the battery cavity. It&rsquo;s tricky to get the battery in without dislodging the rubber bumper, which is bolted on fore and aft (otherwise I&rsquo;d remove it) but only loosely grabs the sides. I keep debating whether I should superglue it. And removing the battery, which I do after every ride to avoid exposing it to temperature extremes, is never as easy as unlocking it and pressing the lever; it usually takes a minute or so of prying with my fingernails before it comes loose.</p>
<p>It could be a lot worse. The battery stays put during rides and lives up to the advertised range. It emits a quiet high-pitched whine while charging, sort of like tinnitus, but it&rsquo;s not a bother unless you&rsquo;re right next to it. And the battery level indicator is reliable, so you know if you need to charge before your next ride.</p>
<p>Finally, I have to say the Specialized app adds a lot of nice extras. I resisted downloading it until recently because I&rsquo;m a bit of a tech curmudgeon. I don&rsquo;t want to log into my fridge, I don&rsquo;t want TCP/IP in my oven/range, and I don&rsquo;t want a monthly subscription to my bike. (The Specialized app is free, but these days I live with the unhappy assumption that everything will eventually be a subscription.) Regardless, I gave in and discovered more than enough to keep me around. For one thing, I often forget to track rides on my smart watch, whereas the app automatically starts tracking when I turn on my bike and start pedaling. And for another, it lets you fine-tune &ldquo;power&rdquo; (percent of motor wattage used) and &ldquo;ease&rdquo; (how hard you have to pedal to access that power) for each assist level. It also exports rides to Apple Health and Strava.</p>
<p>For the price, an e-bike as rugged and well-constructed as this is a good deal. I don&rsquo;t know what I would add, though I&rsquo;ll be happier once I figure out how to make the battery play nice.</p>
<p><strong>Overall rating: 4 out of 5</strong></p>
