  <p>Most people follow the Waterfall development methodology when building a new habit:</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine the end goal and deadline (e.g. I will lose 40 pounds by 2019).</li>
<li>Write the goal down.</li>
<li>Design the habits that will lead up to that goal (e.g. I will stop eating anything that tastes good, and I will exercise five times a week).</li>
<li>Assemble the necessary motivations (e.g. accountability buddy, FitBit, bathroom scale, gym membership, workout routine, diet plan).</li>
<li>Start the habits and do them until the goal is achieved.</li>
<li>Invariably show up to the deadline way behind schedule, and start the process over again.</li>
</ol>
<p>What was wrong with the Waterfall methodology? Ah, I remember, it didn&rsquo;t work very well for modern software (especially with the advent of the Internet). That&rsquo;s why the development world converted almost wholesale to Agile. The problems with Waterfall include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not flexible enough: when technologies or requirements change, there are no allowances for redesigning on the fly.</li>
<li>Not error-tolerant enough: if your deadline is unrealistic or there&rsquo;s a flaw in your design, you don&rsquo;t find out until it&rsquo;s too late.</li>
<li>Under-focused on regular milestones: your goal is to ship a working product in two years. How do you know, on any given week, if you&rsquo;re on target? You probably don&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>Prone to catastrophic wrong-solution-itis: if your software doesn&rsquo;t actually solve the user&rsquo;s problem, then it&rsquo;s useless&mdash;even if it&rsquo;s well-built and ships on time. You won&rsquo;t find out about this until it ships, which is at the very end of the process.</li>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t scale: if you build your software to handle 5,000 users, the one thing you can guarantee is that you won&rsquo;t have 5,000 users. You&rsquo;ll be off by an order of magnitude, and either waste resources or deal with constant overload.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a handful of the reasons why Waterfall isn&rsquo;t the standard any more.</p>
<p>The same problems manifest with goal-setting and -achieving:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexibility: if you get sick, your accountability buddy moves, your gym goes out of business, or you find yourself starving to death within arm&rsquo;s reach of a #9 with extra mayonnaise, what will you do? As any seasoned New Year&rsquo;s resolution breaker knows, the slightest disruption can throw off the whole process.</li>
<li>Error-tolerance: do you really have the motivation to go from zero to hero in the diet and exercise departments <em>simultaneously</em>? I doubt it. In fact, just fixing your diet probably takes more willpower than you have available. You&rsquo;re gonna slip up. Maybe several times in the first week. And if you&rsquo;re like me, eventually you&rsquo;ll give up.</li>
<li>Regular milestones: how much weight do you need to lose per week in order to achieve your goal? Even if you can do the math in your head, you&rsquo;re more focused on that magic number (40 pounds) and it&rsquo;s too easy to say &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t lose any weight this week, but I&rsquo;ll just do double next week.&rdquo; By the middle of the year, you probably have no idea if you&rsquo;re on track or not. Probably not.</li>
<li>Wrong-solution-itis: what if you lose 40 pounds and discover that you don&rsquo;t feel better about yourself? What if you discover that what you really want is a more muscular physique? What if you lose the weight too quickly and get sick?</li>
<li>Scaling: You&rsquo;ve set a goal two years out. What about four years out? What about ten? Once you achieve your goal, it will be all too easy to have a &ldquo;cheat year&rdquo; and end up back where you started.</li>
</ul>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m about to suggest: Agile for your personal life. And if your first thought was &ldquo;standup&rdquo; or &ldquo;sprint planning,&rdquo; I command you to go study <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">The Agile Manifesto</a> until you are cured of this knee-jerk reaction. Standup is not part of the Agile manifesto any more than a muffler is part of a bicycle.</p>
<p>The heart of Agile is building very small, complete, high-value features and shipping them frequently. When it comes to your personal life, habits are like features, and as soon as you become accustomed to them&mdash;as soon as they become weightless and no longer require significant self-control in order to maintain&mdash;you can consider them &ldquo;shipped.&rdquo; And in this analogy, you can see why it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to expect yourself to ship an entire lifestyle between midnight and 12:01 AM on the New Year.</p>
<p>So consider approaching your goals like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine the most valuable habit you can build. This probably emerges from your worst bad habit. If you eat a donut for breakfast every day, your best opportunity to improve your health may be to start eating a healthier breakfast.</li>
<li>Design the smallest effective version of this new habit: the Minimum Viable Habit, as it were. Maybe six days a week you can eat fruit or eggs for breakfast, and still eat a donut once a week.</li>
<li>Assemble only the necessary tools to help you stay on track&mdash;hopefully you won&rsquo;t need many, since it&rsquo;s such a small goal. Still, you may need a frying pan for your eggs or a daily accountability check-in from a friend.</li>
<li>Start in on the habit right away, and schedule some time a week or two from now to reflect on your progress.</li>
<li>Remember, the habit isn&rsquo;t shipped until it doesn&rsquo;t consume gobs of willpower any more. Once you feel that you can sustain this habit forever, move on to the next one.</li>
<li>If the habit isn&rsquo;t working, isn&rsquo;t getting you where you want to go, or is sapping too much willpower, iterate on it. Keep trying something a little different until you find your zen.</li>
<li>Once the habit is shipped, start from step 1 again, adding another habit to the first one.</li>
</ol>
<p>Small, incremental changes to your life are far more likely to be effective than all-in spurts of commitment. I&rsquo;m not the healthiest guy I know, but I&rsquo;ve been to the gym more times and eaten more healthily this year than any other year of my life, and it&rsquo;s all happened very gradually, on a week-to-week basis.</p>
<p>Try it out. Let me know how it goes for you.</p>
