  <p>In March 2023, <a href="https://toot.cafe/@isaaclyman/110025334363786870">I posted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just thinking about how &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve fully recovered from burnout&rdquo; is a sentence I have never seen or heard someone say. Google has 1 result for that sentence (in quotes). Changing &ldquo;fully&rdquo; to &ldquo;completely&rdquo;: also 1 result. Changing to &ldquo;totally&rdquo;: 0 results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><sup>I checked again today. Kagi has a couple results that Google didn&rsquo;t, but not enough to be particularly encouraging.</sup></p>
<p>As you might guess, this wasn&rsquo;t just idle curiosity. I suffered work-related burnout during my first full-time job as a web developer. I&rsquo;d been working too many hours, for too many months, on a disaster cleanup project that felt both impossible and unnecessary. I was overworked and overwhelmed. The idea of getting up for work every Monday completely drained me.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t recognize the symptoms of burnout. Young as I was, I had far too much experience putting up with mental and emotional exhaustion for years at a time. Luckily, my wife wasn&rsquo;t willing to <em>watch</em> me put up with it, so she said something.</p>
<p>In almost the same moment I realized it was okay to quit my job, I made up my mind to do so. I just needed someone, anyone, to give me permission.</p>
<p>That was in 2017. Seven years later, in 2024, I declared myself fully recovered. That&rsquo;s not a worst-case scenario; far from it. Many burnout stories are longer. Some go on for decades. Some people believe they will never recover.</p>
<p>But I recovered, and hopefully that means other people can too. I don&rsquo;t know what will work for anyone else. But I can share what worked for me.</p>
<h2 id="1-quitting">1: Quitting</h2>
<p>There was no alternative to quitting. A vacation of any length would have been laughably insufficient. A raise wouldn&rsquo;t have solved anything. A title or team change would only have prolonged the inevitable.</p>
<p>I needed a clean break.</p>
<p>Quitting was a enormous weight off my chest, even before my two weeks&rsquo; notice was up. And it wasn&rsquo;t just the best thing for me—it was good for everyone. It brought the company&rsquo;s attention to problems they&rsquo;d previously been able to ignore. It gave me a platform to talk about what needed to change. It brought urgency to issues I&rsquo;d been trying to handle on my own; other people got involved and took responsibility. I don&rsquo;t know what happened after I left, but what happened right before I left was better than anything I could have accomplished if I&rsquo;d stayed.</p>
<p>To anyone feeling guilty about the idea: sometimes quitting is the best gift you can give.</p>
<p>But even if it hadn&rsquo;t been, I know enough now to look back and say my health is more important than any project or company. And since my health was at risk, I needed to stop doing what I was doing, and stop thinking about it, forever.</p>
<p>Your health matters, too. You can quit for no other reason than that. You have permission.</p>
<p>My recovery began the day I left that office for the last time.</p>
<h2 id="2-reduced-pressure">2: Reduced pressure</h2>
<p>My next job was completely different, even though my job title was the same. It was at a company that prided itself on being a &ldquo;best place to work,&rdquo; and though the benefits package was impressive, what really made it great was the culture.</p>
<p>Where my previous job had been focused on survival and contract preservation, making work feel like one emergency after another, this job was laser-focused on consistent, sustainable results. They didn&rsquo;t care when (or if) I came into the office, they didn&rsquo;t care when I went to the dentist or the grocery store, and they <em>definitely</em> didn&rsquo;t care how many hours I worked. As long as I kept delivering high-quality software, I was golden.</p>
<p>I think the autonomy was just as important as the flexibility. There were weeks when I took it easy and (very occasionally) weeks when I worked overtime. But what mattered was that nobody was looking over my shoulder, pressuring me to stay later or work harder. How I got from point A to point B was my business. My manager trusted me to get things done, and I made sure not to betray that trust.</p>
<p>I stayed for six years. I would have stayed six more if circumstances hadn&rsquo;t changed. That job gave me space to listen to myself, to rest, to breathe, and to feel a sense of control over my life again. And in return, I gave it the best work I&rsquo;d ever done.</p>
<h2 id="3-healthcare">3: Healthcare</h2>
<p>In 2021 I was diagnosed with a mental health condition and started treatment. I&rsquo;d had the condition my entire life, but it had somehow evaded detection until then.</p>
<p>Finding the right treatment was groundbreaking. The texture of my life changed. New projects felt exciting instead of exhausting. My anxiety levels dropped to a whisper.</p>
<p>Even if there hadn&rsquo;t been a diagnosis to be made, I think therapy would have been an essential part of my recovery. I won&rsquo;t give you my whole spiel about therapy right now, but I have one, and you can guess how it goes.</p>
<p>(Therapy is awesome.)</p>
<h2 id="4-boredom">4: Boredom</h2>
<p>This was how I knew I&rsquo;d recovered from burnout: I felt <em>bored</em> at work. I actually, genuinely wished there was more to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m dead serious about this. For my money, it&rsquo;s the most important part of the equation. If there&rsquo;s one thing you need to experience in order to get better, it&rsquo;s boredom. (Or maybe restlessness?)</p>
<p>The right kind of boredom is more than just repetition and tedium. It&rsquo;s a combination of unfilled time and a lack of challenging work.</p>
<p>That was what my job turned into in 2024, after several rounds of layoffs turned my team into a skeleton crew and any semblance of progress or impact evaporated. I was kept on to maintain a lucrative piece of software that rarely broke down, so most days there wasn&rsquo;t much to do.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take me long to realize I needed more. I couldn&rsquo;t sit around and do nothing all day. I spent six months trying to re-skill and help the team move in a new direction, but ultimately there wasn&rsquo;t a good direction to move in. So I started interviewing elsewhere, and was lucky enough to land at an equally good company with plenty of interesting work to take on.</p>
<p>Being able to jump into new projects, without the gnawing fear that I&rsquo;ll lose my autonomy and burn out again, has been a lot of fun. I&rsquo;m older and wiser—there are lines I won&rsquo;t cross, red flags I know to watch out for—but I no longer feel the deep-rooted weariness, the void where my enthusiasm should be, the incredibly heavy weight of getting up in the morning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing so much better.</p>
<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving forward</h2>
<p>I found my boredom by accident. I don&rsquo;t know how hard it would be to find again. Hopefully I won&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have that kind of luck, your best bet is to avoid burnout in the first place. Easier said than done, I know.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re suffering from burnout, hang in there. I&rsquo;m sending you my best, most free-range organic vibes. Things can get better and I hope they do. You deserve to feel good at work again.</p>
