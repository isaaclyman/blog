<h2 id="are-you-a-coder-programmer-developer-engineer-architect-or-something-else">Are you a coder, programmer, developer, engineer, architect or something else?</h2>
<p>My first job was an underage, under-the-table weekend gig at a pizza parlor. I‚Äôd show up at the local strip mall early Saturday morning, stash my bike, and clock in. For me, the work was grueling. I would haul 50-pound bags of flour and 10-gallon buckets of water to a giant stand mixer, and once it finished spinning I‚Äôd lift armfuls of incredibly heavy dough to a metal table where I‚Äôd cut and oil portions weighed for each size of pizza that the shop sold. By noon, I‚Äôd be exhausted. I‚Äôd clock out and head home. And once a month I‚Äôd pick up an envelope with about $100 cash in it. It was an awesome first job.</p>
<p>My official job title was Dough Boy (yes, like the Pillsbury mascot). But ‚ÄúDough Boy‚Äù isn‚Äôt very impressive on a resume, so for a while I listed my job title as ‚ÄúDough Chef.‚Äù A teenager‚Äôs got to have some dignity, right? In the end, I don‚Äôt think anybody cared.</p>
<p>Little did I know, that was the least problematic job title I would ever have.</p>
<p>I became a programmer several years ago. In 21st-century America‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääespecially in the tech sector‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääjob titles are surprisingly fluid. I haven‚Äôt had an employer dedicate any real thought to my job title for a long time. In fact, my first employer in the industry told me I could put whatever I wanted on my resume and if anyone called she‚Äôd back me up. Naturally, I was tempted to write ‚ÄúSenior Department Lead QA III Technical Architect‚Äù, when in fact I was just writing Selenium tests in a cubicle. Go figure.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve often puzzled over the plethora of job titles I now fit under. I write web applications for a startup, so I do something at every level of the stack, from SQL Server at the bottom to CSS at the top. There are a lot of things I <em>could</em> call myself: coder, programmer, engineer, developer, boffin. In keeping with my pizza-infused legacy, I could even call myself a <a href="https://twitter.com/ivetwodads/status/854358415799312384">Software Boy</a>. So what <em>am</em> I?</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Technical Twitter friends! When someone asks you what you do for a living, what do you say? &quot;I am a ... ___&quot; &lt;fill in the blank&gt; or &lt;other&gt;</p>&mdash; Jen Looper üë©‚Äçüíª (@jenlooper) <a href="https://twitter.com/jenlooper/status/854345325032747009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 18, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôve discovered that I‚Äôm far from the only one who has this question. And there are a lot of variables to consider, so it‚Äôs not an easy one. In some countries it‚Äôs illegal to call yourself an engineer unless you have certain certifications. In some cultures, general words (like ‚Äúconsultant‚Äù) may be preferred over technical jargon (like ‚Äúapplication developer‚Äù). And in the United States, where I live, small differences in a job title can make a significant difference in salary.</p>
<p>This is my attempt to aggregate all the data I can find about the swath of job titles that apply to people who code. I‚Äôve gathered average salary information and definitions for several job titles that might apply (but surely not all of them). If you see a significant omission or error, please let me know.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve ignored titles like <em>hacker</em>, <em>ninja</em>, and <em>rockstar</em> because they‚Äôre frivolous and meaningless. In fact, I‚Äôve only ever seen them used by exceptionally incompetent recruiters.</p>
<h3 id="sources">Sources</h3>
<p>I‚Äôve got salary information from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Glassdoor, PayScale, and Indeed. Definitions come from the BLS or Wikipedia where available. Where neither has a definition, I‚Äôve searched out the most succinct, authoritative source I can find.</p>
<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<p>This data is categorized by job title. Job titles are ordered by a subjective estimate of their complexity, from least complex to most complex. Data was gathered in April 2017.</p>
<p>Each entry has a definition, national (USA) median salary data from each source, an average of the salary data points, and a variability assessment (how wide the range of salary estimates is). Where a specific job title or equivalent was not found in a database, ‚ÄúN/D‚Äù is used.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> PayScale.com uses the words ‚Äúaverage‚Äù and ‚Äúmedian‚Äù interchangeably. Do they even <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/articles/chooseyourwords/mean-median-average/">math</a>? Glassdoor and Indeed don‚Äôt offer a median at all, preferring a <a href="https://surveymethods.com/blog/when-is-it-generally-better-to-use-median-over-mean/">much less useful</a> average. In a perfect world everyone would use medians for data sets like this, since they may or may not follow a normal curve.</p>

<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>
<h4 id="salary">Salary</h4>
<p>Job titles by salary from lowest to highest are: Junior Software Developer, <strong>Web Developer</strong> , <strong>Programmer</strong> , Front End Developer, Developer, <strong>Software Developer</strong> , Software Engineer, Senior Software Developer, and Software Architect (Coder and Full Stack Developer were lacking data). Since the BLS likely has the largest and least-biased data set, I‚Äôve bolded the titles for which BLS data was available. Incidentally, the ordering of the list holds when BLS data is considered alone.</p>
<p>This data should be taken with a grain of salt for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don‚Äôt have access to the original data sets. I don‚Äôt know the size of those data sets or the algorithms used to calculate their average/median. I don‚Äôt have access to demographics data, so important variables like race, gender, orientation and class aren‚Äôt considered here. A data set of known size and diversity would yield better analysis.</li>
<li>Glassdoor and Indeed are fundamentally job boards, not public data sets. Their data is based on volunteered information: self-reported salaries and job postings. This makes it prone to non-response bias, among other forms of survey bias.</li>
<li>PayScale, Glassdoor and Indeed are private companies and their data isn‚Äôt open source. Any private company is accountable to its shareholders, not the general public, and may therefore be incentivized to gather and calculate data in a way that increases the value of their product to customers. For example, employers posting jobs on Indeed may prefer the site to report lower average salary data, which would make their salary offers seem more competitive. Indeed could do this by focusing its marketing on regions with low cost of living and low average salary, which would skew its self-reported salary data toward the lower end of the scale. I‚Äôm not saying they do this, but it would be legal and profitable for them to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>The difference in average salary between a Developer and a Software Developer is about $3k, which probably is not statistically significant. On the other hand, the difference between a Software Developer and a Software Engineer is $6k, which might be meaningful. The biggest leap in salary is from Software Engineer to Senior Software Developer, with a difference of about $15.5k.</p>
<p>There are several more slight variations in wording that I could have looked into. A Senior Software Engineer, for example, probably makes a little bit more than a Senior Software Developer, and a Senior or Chief Software Architect surely makes more than a Software Architect. But this should be enough to provide insight into a general trend.</p>
<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<p>Enough with the cash: what‚Äôs the <em>qualitative</em> difference between these roles?</p>
<p>First of all, some titles to avoid (or at least approach with caution):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Coder</em> had the lowest Glassdoor salary of any position I looked at, even lower than Junior Software Developer. It‚Äôs hard to argue in its favor. First of all, it‚Äôs much too brazen‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs like a construction worker calling himself a Nailer or a doctor calling herself a Scalpeler. ‚ÄúCode‚Äù is better as a noun than a verb; it‚Äôs a tool you use to achieve a goal. If a candidate for a position at my company billed themself as a Coder, it would give me the impression that they like to be told what to do and how to do it‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat is, they‚Äôll write the code, but they won‚Äôt make decisions, interact with people, or suggest ways to improve. That sounds like an unfulfilling way to build software. What‚Äôs worse, an employer who creates a job posting for a Coder probably isn‚Äôt looking for someone who engineers elegant solutions to complex problems‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey probably have only a shallow understanding of what software is, and want to hire the cheapest person they can find to ‚Äújust build a really simple app.‚Äù</li>
<li><em>Full Stack Developer</em> seems to beg the question, ‚Äúbut what are you <em>good</em> at?‚Äù As I‚Äôve mentioned, people tend to be incredulous of a candidate who claims to be an expert at every level of the stack. There‚Äôs simply no way a normal person can keep up with everything. And knowing a single technology at each layer (say, JavaScript, REST, ASP.NET and SQL Server) probably doesn‚Äôt cut it. Sure, those are the technologies in <em>your</em> stack, but someone else‚Äôs stack may consist of Dart, Falcor, Python and Couchbase. You‚Äôre not a Full Stack Developer where they‚Äôre concerned. At best you‚Äôre a regular Developer who‚Äôs willing to learn some new tech.</li>
<li><em>(Computer) Programmer</em> is a term that‚Äôs gone the way of the dinosaur, along with the stereotype of the shirt-and-tie-wearing geek in an ivory tower. <a href="http://chrislema.com/programmer-developer-engineer/">All the word really means</a> is <em>someone who knows a programming language</em>. This used to be a rare skill (and only moderately in demand). But modern software construction demands more than just syntax and vocabulary‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe essential domains of ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbecause modern <em>software</em> is more than just a command-line interface and a set of database files on a floppy disk. Apps have to be beautiful, accessible, user-friendly, fast, and above all, competitive. The word ‚ÄúProgrammer‚Äù doesn‚Äôt evoke any of that.</li>
<li><em>Developer</em> is, as previously noted, an unnecessarily ambiguous title. If your job involves building condominiums, you‚Äôre reading the wrong article. If your job involves computer code, you should call yourself a <em>Software</em> Developer. Anything built with code is software, so this is more about clarification than qualification. And, according to the internet, it raises your market value by about $2.5k.</li>
<li><em>Front End Developer</em> is a very volatile title. Not only does it have the highest salary variability of all the job titles researched, but anecdotally I‚Äôve heard it defined in contradictory ways. For some people, <em>Front End Developer</em> refers to a person who knows HTML and CSS but not JavaScript; for others, a Front End Developer is someone who has a deep knowledge of JavaScript and its most popular frameworks and libraries. The solution, in my mind, is to call yourself a <em>JavaScript Developer</em> if that‚Äôs where your expertise lies, and to not call yourself anything if all you know is HTML and CSS. Seriously, go learn a programming language.</li>
</ul>
<p>The remaining titles differ semantically, but not in ways that necessarily make any of them superior. You should determine which one best describes your career trajectory:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Software Developer</em> and <em>Software Engineer</em> are, by many accounts, equivalent. Both mean that a person knows the best practices in their field, is comfortable with multiple technologies, and has transferable skills that allow them to recognize and write good code in any language. These titles also indicate the ability to make well-reasoned decisions about software design and implementation, and a willingness to participate in the software lifecycle above and beyond writing code. <a href="/blog/posts/developer-driven-development">Developers and engineers are creative, thoughtful, knowledgeable people who deserve a place at the table in every discussion about a product</a>. ‚ÄúEngineer‚Äù connotes more seniority and preciseness than ‚ÄúDeveloper‚Äù, so younger developers run the risk of sounding pretentious if they bill themselves as Engineers. Considering that the average salary difference between them is only about $6k, you‚Äôre probably okay to go with your gut on this one.</li>
<li><em>Web Developer</em> is a title that flirts with ambiguity, if less dangerously than <em>Front End Developer</em>. I‚Äôve seen the term used to mean ‚Äúa person who builds web applications, including the server side‚Äù or just ‚Äúa person who knows JavaScript.‚Äù But as unclear as it is to industry insiders, it may be perfect for freelancers who cater to a ‚Äújust make me a website‚Äù clientele. Most individuals and small business owners don‚Äôt understand the complexities of front-end and back-end; if they hire a developer, it‚Äôs to create an attractive single-purpose site that will show up in Google results. I suspect that <em>Web Developer</em> is exactly what they‚Äôre looking for. If you‚Äôre not a contractor, <em>Software Developer</em> may describe you more efficiently (and give you a nearly $20k bump in average salary).</li>
<li><em>Junior</em> and <em>Senior</em> are prefixes that make a big difference in salary. Generally speaking, you‚Äôre a <em>Junior Developer</em> for your first few years or so in the industry, and you‚Äôre not a <em>Senior Developer</em> until several years after that. But most developers agree that graduating from <em>Junior Developer</em> to <em>Developer</em> and from <em>Developer</em> to <em>Senior Developer</em> has less to do with the length of your career and more to do with your humility, leadership, versatility, and experience (especially the number of catastrophic failures under your belt).</li>
<li><em>Software Architect</em> is the most highly-paid job title on this list, and with good reason. It represents a high standard and has a stable definition industry-wide. The Software Architect is the ultimate technological resource‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe person who‚Äôs been there and done that so many times that they can practically see the future. At the company where I work, the Enterprise Architect is equal in status to the CTO. It‚Äôs a position of extreme responsibility and respect. You probably already know if this is you.</li>
<li>One more title I didn‚Äôt investigate in depth is <em>x Developer</em> or <em>x Engineer</em>, where <em>x</em> is a specific language, framework or technology. For example, I could call myself a <em>JavaScript Developer</em>, an <em>AngularJS Developer</em>, or a¬†<em>.NET Engineer</em>, and this would remove the ambiguity about what I‚Äôm primarily good at. I would choose one of the above based on my career goals, or combine two of them, e.g. <em>AngularJS/.NET Developer</em>. To look at every kind of <em>x Developer</em> would have increased the scope of this article far beyond its original purpose, but in my opinion it‚Äôs the most useful job title there is for someone who codes. Of course, if you don‚Äôt feel comfortable associating yourself with a specific technology, <em>Software Developer</em> is a totally acceptable alternative.</li>
</ul>
<p>Embarrassingly enough, my own resume‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwritten long before I began research on this topic‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsays I‚Äôm a Full Stack Developer. I‚Äôll be fixing that right away.</p>
<p>I hope the data I‚Äôve provided is valuable. If you‚Äôre still determining your own job title, I wish you the best of luck.</p>
