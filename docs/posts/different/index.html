  <p>You know how sometimes when you don&rsquo;t pay enough attention, two similar but not identical things will occupy the same space in your brain? And you&rsquo;ll go along thinking they&rsquo;re the same until you&rsquo;re 30 years old and see them in the same sentence and suddenly realize they&rsquo;re not the same at all?</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ve never had this problem. I might not be playing with a full deck.</p>
<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s a list of all the things I&rsquo;ve been surprised to find out are different. Most of them are highly embarrassing and/or would preclude me from ever running for office.</p>
<h2 id="addison-rae-and-tate-mcrae">Addison Rae and Tate McRae</h2>
<p>I still could not name a song by either of these people. They&rsquo;re both from Canada, right? Are they siblings?</p>
<h2 id="ajr-and-twenty-one-pilots">AJR and Twenty One Pilots</h2>
<p>Music for people who like skim milk.</p>
<h2 id="ben-stiller-and-ben-affleck">Ben Stiller and Ben Affleck</h2>
<p>About 10 minutes into <em>Good Will Hunting</em>, which I finally watched in 2025 A.D., I was like, &ldquo;Huh, that doesn&rsquo;t look like the guy from <em>Night at the Museum.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="_call-of-duty_-and-_battlefield_"><em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Battlefield</em></h2>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t played either of these, as far as I know. It&rsquo;s impossible to be sure.</p>
<h2 id="dates-and-prunes">Dates and prunes</h2>
<p>They&rsquo;re both shaped like what you think of when you hear the word &ldquo;pod&rdquo; and they slow down your teeth when you bite into them. You get it.</p>
<h2 id="debutante-dilettante-and-delinquent">Debutante, dilettante, and delinquent</h2>
<p>Better to just avoid these words altogether.</p>
<h2 id="drew-barrymore-and-reese-witherspoon">Drew Barrymore and Reese Witherspoon</h2>
<p>They both exist, but only one of them is married to Ryan Reynolds? How is that fair?</p>
<h2 id="james-franco-and-dave-franco">James Franco and Dave Franco</h2>
<p>I bet you didn&rsquo;t know there were two Francos, either. This is normal. I&rsquo;m normal.</p>
<h2 id="jeff-bridges-and-jeff-daniels">Jeff Bridges and Jeff Daniels</h2>
<p>I thought <em>The Big Lebowski</em> was pretty good. Please tell me one of these men was in <em>Big Lebowski</em>.</p>
<h2 id="lightning-cables-and-thunderbolt-cables">Lightning cables and Thunderbolt cables</h2>
<p>If you try to explain the difference I <em>will</em> get a restraining order.</p>
<h2 id="margaret-thatcher-and-margaret-atwood">Margaret Thatcher and Margaret Atwood</h2>
<p>The UK isn&rsquo;t that big. I can keep track of one Margaret, tops.</p>
<h2 id="mariah-carey-and-carrie-underwood">Mariah Carey and Carrie Underwood</h2>
<p>Music for people who like belt buckles that look like hubcaps.</p>
<h2 id="medusa-and-ursula">Medusa and Ursula</h2>
<p>These ones aren&rsquo;t even real. You can&rsquo;t be mad at me for not knowing every Disney character.</p>
<h2 id="_outer-wilds_-and-_outer-worlds_"><em>Outer Wilds</em> and <em>Outer Worlds</em></h2>
<p>I have played both of these. There&rsquo;s one of them where I&rsquo;m allowed to say I didn&rsquo;t love it, and one where I have to keep my mouth shut.</p>
<h2 id="pecans-and-walnuts">Pecans and walnuts</h2>
<p>They&rsquo;re both wrinkly nuts that you don&rsquo;t eat very often. We should split the difference and call them both &ldquo;peanuts.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="samosa-and-mimosa">Samosa and mimosa</h2>
<p>French restaurants are hard for me, okay?</p>
<h2 id="shallots-scallops-and-scallions">Shallots, scallops, and scallions</h2>
<p>Out of everything on the list, this is the mix-up most likely to ruin whatever you&rsquo;re cooking. I mean, shallots and scallions are probably okay to swap. Scallops would be a disaster, though. It&rsquo;s like the Monty Hall problem in reverse.</p>
<h2 id="sherbet-and-sorbet">Sherbet and sorbet</h2>
<p>Snow cones masquerading as ice cream. Despicable.</p>
<h2 id="troy-baker-and-troye-sivan">Troy Baker and Troye Sivan</h2>
<p>You have to admit there&rsquo;s an &ldquo;evil twin&rdquo; vibe here.</p>
