  <p>I’m relatively young on the programming scene (I wasn&rsquo;t around when FORTRAN came out or anything) so this is a hubristic thing to say, but it feels like we’ve reached Peak Programming Languages. For anything you want to build and any way you want to build it, there&rsquo;s a mature and popular language already available. Typically the community around it is robust and the syntax is delightful. I mean, just <em>try</em> writing a few lines of C# or Dart and tell me it doesn&rsquo;t feel nice.</p>
<p>I made this flowchart recommending a language based on what you&rsquo;re building and the features you value most in a programming language. I left out a <em>lot</em> of languages (including 8 of the <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">top 20</a>) and for every leaf node on the chart, there&rsquo;s another option or three I could have chosen instead. But it&rsquo;s my chart, so you get my opinions.</p>

<p>It’s an unprecedented environment for new general-purpose languages to be competing in. People are definitely still creating them, but in 2023 more than ever, you might wonder why. Do any of them have a hope of gaining market share? Is it worth taking a chance on a new language, even one with some cool ideas or novel syntax, when you could use an established alternative with an enormous developer community and open-source ecosystem? What niche remains so painfully unfilled that we would all jump ship for a newcomer?</p>
<p>Of course, there are plenty of reasons to create a programming language other than trying to take the world by storm. It&rsquo;s fun, for one. It breeds new ideas that often get adopted into existing programming languages, for another. And if nothing else, it&rsquo;s one of the best ways to build your understanding of programming. We shouldn&rsquo;t stop making languages. If anything, we should be making <em>more</em> of them. But some of these new programming languages seem to be making a genuine effort to grow and establish a user base, and while I don&rsquo;t begrudge them that, I again ask <em>why</em>? I could happily use C#, Dart, Rust, and TypeScript for everything I build for the rest of my life. I can create anything I want, any way I want. I am happy.</p>
<p>I probably sound like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>640K [of RAM] ought to be enough for anybody.</p>
<p>~Bill Gates, 1981 (<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2534312/the--640k--quote-won-t-go-away----but-did-gates-really-say-it-.html">allegedly</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All right, then correct me. What&rsquo;s still missing? What innovations have I overlooked? What brand-new language is going to be a huge deal in five years?</p>
<p>Maybe we haven&rsquo;t hit the Peak. That&rsquo;s up for debate. But we sure are spoiled for choice. It&rsquo;s an incredible time to be writing code.</p>
