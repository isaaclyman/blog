  <p>Central nervous system stimulants such as Adderall, Ritalin, and Vyvanse are commonly used to treat ADHD and narcolepsy in children and adults. Common side effects of these drugs are increased blood pressure and heart rate. Anecdotally, many patients and doctors assume that there are negative long-term heart consequences for stimulant use, even when taken as prescribed and in approved doses. The purpose of this article is to review the available research and determine if this concern is supported by the evidence.</p>
<h2 id="disclaimers">Disclaimers</h2>
<p>I am not a doctor. This is not medical advice. Consult your doctor before starting any new treatment.</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I have a bias in favor of stimulant treatment for ADHD. I&rsquo;ve listened to many ADHD experts speak on the subject and they have an overwhelming consensus view in favor of it. I made every effort to set this bias aside while researching the topic.</p>
<h2 id="hypothesis">Hypothesis</h2>
<p>My guess is that stimulant use would lead to a small increase in adverse cardiovascular events like heart attack and stroke, more frequently in adults, and especially in patients with preexisting heart conditions.</p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>I searched PubMed for the term &ldquo;stimulant heart.&rdquo; I considered the first 50 results, as well as the &ldquo;Similar articles&rdquo; for each relevant study, and each of their &ldquo;Similar articles,&rdquo; following the chain of related articles until no more relevant articles were found. I ignored studies that were about caffeine, MDMA, cocaine, or intentional drug abuse, or did not consider heart health. I also ignored the few studies that did not have an abstract or summary publicly available on PubMed. Personal bias was not a criteria for exclusion. I reviewed and summarized the abstract, results, or conclusion of each relevant study, with a total of 37 studies found. Skip to the bottom for a general summary.</p>

<p>A review of 10 studies on stimulant use for ADHD in adults aged 22 to 40 found an increase in resting heart rate (+5.7 bpm; a normal resting heart rate is between 60 and 100 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (+2 mmHg; normal systolic blood pressure is 120 mmHg or less). The study did not include clinical outcomes and recommended further research.</p>

<p>This meta-analysis acknowledges concerns about &ldquo;the potential for rare but serious cardiovascular adverse events&rdquo; when stimulants are used to treat ADHD. It notes that both stimulants and non-stimulants, such as atomoxetine (Strattera), can increase blood pressure and heart rate. Guanfacine and clonidine (α(2)-adrenergic agonists, also non-stimulants) are known to cause small decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. But across all modes of treatment, the review finds that &ldquo;The risk for serious cardiovascular adverse events, including statistically or clinically significant increases in QTc, and sudden cardiac death associated with stimulants, atomoxetine or α(2)-adrenergic agonists prescribed for ADHD is extremely low and the benefits of treating individual patients with ADHD, after an adequate assessment, outweigh the risks. However, great caution is advised when considering stimulant and non-stimulant medications for patients of any age with a diagnosis of ADHD and a personal or family history or other known risk factors for cardiovascular disease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Currently available data suggest that there is no evidence for serious adverse cardiovascular complications in children with known cardiovascular diseases including patients of congenital heart disease who are treated with stimulant medications. Despite this, if the patient does have known cardiac disease, or if the history and physical examination is suggestive of cardiac disease, it is suggested that consultation/evaluation with a pediatric cardiologist occur. It is extremely unlikely that stimulant medications would be contraindicated in almost any condition that falls under this category. However, a few specific cardiac conditions might tailor the choice of the specific ADHD medication.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the past two years, large retrospective, population-based cohort studies were performed. These studies did not show any evidence that methylphenidate was associated with an increase in risk of myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, or stroke. Treatment of children with methylphenidate is not significantly associated with an increase in the short term or mid-term risk of severe cardiac events.&rdquo; The study notes, however, that there are gaps in our knowledge; there may be long-term effects on heart rate and blood pressure, and it&rsquo;s advisable to screen a patient for undiscovered heart disease or cardiovascular risk factors before prescribing stimulants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Statistically significant pre-post increases of SBP [systolic blood pressure], DBP [diastolic blood pressure] and HR [heart rate] were associated with AMP and ATX treatment in children and adolescents with ADHD, while MPH treatment had a statistically significant effect only on SBP in these patients. These increases may be clinically significant for a significant minority of individuals that experience larger increases. Since increased BP and HR in general are considered risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality during adult life, paediatric patients using ADHD medication should be monitored closely and regularly for HR and BP.&rdquo; Interestingly, no significant difference was found based on &ldquo;type of medication, doses, sample size, age, gender, type of ADHD, comorbidity or dropout rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Electrocardiogram testing was done on children while they were stimulant-free and then again while they were on stimulants. &ldquo;The main findings of this study were that methylphenidate usage is associated with increases in heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP), and that it does not adversely affect HR-corrected QT and JT intervals or cardiac dispersion values.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Complaints related to methylphenidate treatment in children are reviewed. &ldquo;The more easily quantifiable side effects (e.g., blood pressure [BP], heart rate [HR], height/weight) are mostly transient, dose-dependent, easily rectified with dosage adjustments, and considered minor from a clinical perspective considering the breadth and level of improvement in behavior and cognitive functioning observed in most children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Insurance databases were analyzed to determine the risk of cardiovascular events like sudden death, heart attack, and stroke after beginning methylphenidate treatment in adults. Rates of sudden death were about 2 in 1,000 for methylphenidate users and about 1 in 1,000 for non-users; after adjustment, the risk was determined to be about 1.8 times higher for methylphenidate users. The authors say that &ldquo;the lack of a dose-response relationship suggests that this association may not be a causal one.&rdquo; In other words, it seems unlikely that methylphenidate was the <em>cause</em> of sudden death in any of those cases. Risk of stroke and heart attack did not differ between users and non-users.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is growing evidence to suggest that amphetamines do not cause statistically or clinically significant increases in QTc. Sudden death remains an extremely rare event and there is no clear evidence to attribute this to methylphenidate. Some data even suggest that the risk of sudden death in treated children may be less common than in the background population. Limited data suggest that atomoxetine may increase BP and HR in the short term; in the long term it appears to increase BP. The effects of atomoxetine on QTc remain uncertain. Use of this drug does not appear to be associated with sudden death. Because the current evidence is based on research that has not been specifically designed to investigate the cardiovascular effects of these drugs it is difficult to draw firm conclusions, and further work is required specifically to address these questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Among young and middle-aged adults, current or new use of ADHD medications, compared with nonuse or remote use, was not associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events. Apparent protective associations likely represent healthy-user bias.&rdquo; Healthy-user bias is a research flaw caused by the fact that people who use preventive medications are often wealthier and more health-conscious than people who do not, and therefore have better health outcomes. The authors say this probably explains why occasionally we see <em>fewer</em> cardiovascular problems in stimulant users.</p>

<p>A UK database of patients aged 2 to 21 was analyzed for cases of sudden death and suicide. &ldquo;This study demonstrated no increase in the risk of sudden death associated with stimulants or atomoxetine. However, an increased risk of suicide was seen. Although we cannot exclude that the medications may contribute to the increased risk of suicide, there are other factors such as depression and antisocial behaviour that frequently co-exist with ADHD, which can also predispose to teenage suicide. Clinicians should identify patients at increased risk of cardiovascular events and identify those patients at increased risk of suicide, particularly males with co-morbid conditions, and monitor them appropriately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Data from placebo-controlled and open-label extension trials published after 2000 were reviewed, and cardiovascular adverse event data were compared. Both placebo-controlled and open-label extension trials have repeatedly shown stimulant-induced increases in mean blood pressure, heart rate, and QT interval in children, adolescents, and adults. Although these increases seem relatively minor, their existence raises questions regarding whether stimulants could influence the likelihood of sudden death or other serious cardiovascular consequences, especially in patients with underlying heart problems.&rdquo; The authors recommend an electrocardiogram before starting treatment, as long as it&rsquo;s not too expensive.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>I (wrongly) expected to find that stimulants are bad for your heart. I was prepared to reassess my own stimulant use and act to minimize my long-term risk, even if it meant more difficulties with daily symptom management. However, across every study that came up, I found no compelling indications that stimulants cause heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or other cardiovascular problems (outside of a small increased risk for new users over 65). The few studies that found an association were full of stated caveats and uncertainties. There are reported cases of unexpected heart attacks in stimulant users, but heart attacks are also reported in healthy people who don&rsquo;t use any drugs at all. It&rsquo;s not clear that there&rsquo;s any correlation, let alone a direct causation.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s abundantly proven that Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse, and even Strattera cause a &ldquo;modest increase&rdquo; in heart rate and systolic blood pressure, there is no evidence that they cause an increase in heart attacks or other adverse heart events over the long term, and studies have found no increased risk over the short and medium term. Even if there are effects at the high end of the confidence interval, the absolute risk is still very small. Whether they use stimulants are not, there&rsquo;s no reason the average person should be worried about getting a heart attack. Many study authors express speculative concern about possible effects all the same, so some precautions (such as increased monitoring or lower doses) may be valuable if you have a family history of cardiovascular disease. And, of course, overdosing stimulants in order to get high is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>It seems that some stimulant users do not tolerate intense exercise as well as non-stimulant users. If you have trouble with prolonged cardiovascular exercise, talk with your doctor and maybe consider lower-impact forms of exercise.</p>
<p>The beneficial effects of stimulant medication for people with ADHD are well-known and, for most people, outweigh the negative side effects by a considerable factor. Stimulant users who take their medication as prescribed are far less likely to develop a substance abuse disorder and other mental health issues. Stimulants allow people with ADHD to enjoy a higher quality of life and greater success in school, work, and relationships. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that many people with ADHD find it extremely hard to exercise and eat well, and report that stimulants make it possible for them to control their impulses and make better health-related decisions.</p>
