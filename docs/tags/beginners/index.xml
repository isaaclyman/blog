      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing a book: a complete guide to your first year as a developer. And I&amp;rsquo;m looking for co-authors.
It&amp;rsquo;s not a technical manual about Python or Kubernetes or Angular. And it&amp;rsquo;s not a deep-dive about refactoring or craftsmanship. It&amp;rsquo;s a guide to the other stuff: resume writing, getting that first job, ethics, career progression, what to do when you&amp;rsquo;re stuck.
The book will be pay-what-you-want (minimum price of free).</description>

 I occasionally get a message from a brand-new developer who&amp;rsquo;s overwhelmed by all the technologies and choices that exist in the world of software development. Where do you even start? Some of these devs have seen job advertisements like the following:</description>

      <title>This is how HTTPS works</title>

      <description>Most people are familiar with the http:// that begins web site URLs. And some may have noticed that any website with a login form or sensitive information starts with https:// instead. The &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; stands for &amp;ldquo;Secure,&amp;rdquo; and the algorithms that make it work are crazy and wonderful. To understand why HTTPS is so magical, let&amp;rsquo;s use an analogy.
Suppose you gather three accomplished programmers: Janice, Natalia, and Mario. These three have never met or communicated in any way.</description>

 Part of a programmer&amp;rsquo;s job is chasing down missing semicolons and complex caching issues, scrutinizing and head-scratching over every line of code in an application. This is one of the most frustrating things about code: we use it to offload complexity from our brains, but the inverse of this benefit is that any useful program will be too complex for us to wrap our minds around completely.</description>

I feel very privileged to lead the life I lead. I live in a good neighborhood. I can change jobs if I don&amp;rsquo;t like the one I have. I haven&amp;rsquo;t worried about how to pay for groceries since 2013. If I were to list all my blessings, I could go on forever&amp;mdash;but in short, I lead a far better life than I deserve and I&amp;rsquo;m anything but self-made.</description>

 When you start out coding, you usually spend a year or two completely oblivious to the rules of “good code.” You may hear words like “elegant” or “clean” tossed around, but you can’t define them.</description>
