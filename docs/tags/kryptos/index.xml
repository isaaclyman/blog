Kryptos 4 is, I repeat, unsolved. We&amp;rsquo;re very unlikely to solve it today. Enthusiastic codebreakers have been putting together clues and proposing theories for decades. At least half of them are like this:
But hey, since we&amp;rsquo;ve got some code ready to go, we might as well try.
Setup All the code we&amp;rsquo;ve written so far is available on GitHub.</description>

Kryptos 3 is going to require more code than anything else so far. It&amp;rsquo;s encoded using both the types of transposition we covered in Part 2, plus a twist.
It&amp;rsquo;s written out with a rectangle size of 86 and a block size of 7. The columns are stacked. A keyed columnar cipher is applied with the key &amp;lsquo;KRYPTOS&amp;rsquo;. (KRYPTOS is seven characters long, which is why our block size is 7.</description>

In the previous post we solved Kryptos 1 and 2. Kryptos 3 is going to be a bit tougher. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t use our trusty Vigenere cipher. And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t use just one cipher, either; it uses two. We&amp;rsquo;ll learn them separately in this post, then use them together in the next one.
Keyed columnar transposition We need to learn a transposition cipher, which is where the letters in a message are rearranged but not changed.</description>

On the campus of CIA headquarters in Virginia, United States, there&amp;rsquo;s a 34-year-old sculpture called Kryptos. It somewhat resembles a heavy copper flag waving in the wind. Cut out of its surface are 1,736 uppercase ASCII characters split into four encrypted messages and a Vigenere cipher table.
The first three messages were decrypted in the 1990s, first by the NSA and CIA, who didn&amp;rsquo;t publicize their success, and then by a private-sector computer scientist, who did.</description>
