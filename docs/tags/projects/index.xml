      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing a book: a complete guide to your first year as a developer. And I&amp;rsquo;m looking for co-authors.
It&amp;rsquo;s not a technical manual about Python or Kubernetes or Angular. And it&amp;rsquo;s not a deep-dive about refactoring or craftsmanship. It&amp;rsquo;s a guide to the other stuff: resume writing, getting that first job, ethics, career progression, what to do when you&amp;rsquo;re stuck.
The book will be pay-what-you-want (minimum price of free).</description>

Edward has these main pages:
Plan A plan is a set of general notes that you&amp;rsquo;ll want to refer back to as you write your book, no matter which chapter you&amp;rsquo;re working on.</description>

      <description>Introduction Edward is a web app designed to help aspiring authors write their first novel.
It all started with a simple question: what if word processors are the worst possible apps for writing novels?
Take Microsoft Word, for example. It has a lot of formatting and layout tools. Bold, italic, multiple columns, 3D leopard-print text, it&amp;rsquo;s all included.
But you have to know what you want to write with those 3D words, and that&amp;rsquo;s your real problem anyway.</description>
