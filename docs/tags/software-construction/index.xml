      <description>An introduction to environments Most software companies have their product deployed to a few different environments, which have names like local, dev, test, stage, and production. On my first day as a developer I was confused about why there were so many steps between a developer&amp;rsquo;s computer and the app that customers used. It seemed inefficient and bureaucratic. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to appreciate those environments, though, and these days I break out in an ice-cold sweat if someone talks about deploying straight to production.</description>

      <description>The company I work for is slowly losing its &amp;ldquo;startup&amp;rdquo; status. I’m trying not to be too nostalgic about it. After all, it means we’re doing well; a slew of truly impressive awards and contracts in recent months means we’re doing great. There’s a lot to be grateful for. At the same time, a lot is changing.
As this transition has played out, we’ve had to upgrade a few things.</description>
